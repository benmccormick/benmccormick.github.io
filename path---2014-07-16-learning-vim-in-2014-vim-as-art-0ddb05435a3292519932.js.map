But for those interested, Drew Neil has a <a href=\\\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/converting-markdown-to-structured-html-with-a-macro/\\\">great screencast</a> on how to build a good Vim macro.</li>\\n<li>On a similar note, Drew’s book <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=1934356980&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=benmccormicko-20&#x26;linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS\\\">Practical Vim</a> is the best guide I’ve found on making good use of repetition in Vim.  I learned plenty of the stuff in this article from that book.  For those who don’t want to pay, I’m currently giving <a href=\\\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/11/new-twitter-feed-and-practical-vim-giveaway/\\\">new subscribers a chance to win 2 copies of the book</a>.  You can also see more about repetition from Drew online at <a href=\\\"http://vimcasts.org/categories/repetition/\\\">Vimcasts</a>.</li>\\n<li>Tim Pope has published a plugin that allows you to extend the dot command to work on arbitrary user commands.  It also works out of the box with many of his other plugins.  You can see it on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat\\\">Github</a>.</li>\\n</ul>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Art\",\"keywords\":\"vim dot command\",\"category\":\"tools\",\"date\":\"2014-07-16T10:41:00+00:00\",\"path\":\"/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"hideFooter\":null},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art\",\"relatedPosts\":[{\"path\":\"/learning-vim-in-2014\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Learning Vim in 2014\",\"path\":\"/learning-vim-in-2014\",\"description\":\"A series of beginner level articles on Vim\",\"date\":null}},{\"path\":\"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Vim Workflows: File Switching\",\"path\":\"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies\",\"description\":\"A look at the different approaches you can take to managing files in Vim\",\"date\":\"2014-11-10T04:06:52+00:00\"}},{\"path\":\"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language\",\"data\":{\"title\":\"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language\",\"path\":\"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language\",\"description\":\"An explanation of the grammar behind Vim\",\"date\":\"2014-07-02T11:27:00+00:00\"}}]}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/2014-07-16-learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art.json\n// module id = 664\n// module chunks = 38779265224460"],"sourceRoot":""}
