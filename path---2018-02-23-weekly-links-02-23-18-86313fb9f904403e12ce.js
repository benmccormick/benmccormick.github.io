No features have been confirmed yet, but worth a bookmark.  He also has links to his detailed articles about the various candidate features if you’re interested in seeing where JavaScript is headed next.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-javascript-supply-chain-paradox-sri-csp-and-trust-in-third-party-libraries/">The JavaScript Supply Chain Paradox: SRI, CSP and Trust in Third Party Libraries | Troy Hunt</a> - This is a great reminder on why including scripts from 3rd party domains is a risky business, and how to do it securely.</p>\n<h4>Computer Science</h4>\n<p>After my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/">post on Computer Science</a> this week, I thought I’d share 2 CS-y links I came across this week.</p>\n<p><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401">How to think in graphs: an illustrative introduction to Graph Theory and its applications | Vardan Grigoryan</a> -  This is a nice “plain language” explanation of basic graph theory.  It’s a bit long, but it’s a nice thing to look at for the folks who told me this week they want to know more about data structures.</p>\n<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2BL3YHo">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns | Addy Osmani</a> - One of the better “CS for front end” resources I’m aware of is Addy Osmani’s book on JavaScript design patterns.  Like a lot of things in JS land, parts of it haven’t aged well now that it’s a 6 year old book (it’s very focused on jQuery and DOM manipulation in many of its examples), but since it’s centered around more timeless design patterns, I think it holds up well.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Weekly Links: February 23rd",keywords:"computer science scripts es2019",category:"opinion",date:"2018/02/23",path:"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/",layout:"weekly-links",hideFooter:null},fields:{slug:"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/",relatedPosts:[{path:"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt",data:{title:"Bayesian Witch Hunt",path:"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt",description:"A nerd tribute from a friend",date:"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{path:"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems",data:{title:"I hate computing ecosystems",path:"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems",description:"Why does nothing work together?",date:"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{path:"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website",data:{title:"Medium: The end of History and the last website",path:"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website",description:"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?",date:"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]}}}});
