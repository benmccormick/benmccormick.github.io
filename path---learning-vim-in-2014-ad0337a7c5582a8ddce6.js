It was inspired by my own experience learning Vim, running into many out of date resources and online resources that gave me just a quick list of tips, plugins or commands.\n<p>This is a “point in time” snapshot of one man’s advice on how to learn Vim.  It is by no means comprehensive.  I covered some topics in depth, and only skimmed others.  But it’s intended to get new Vim users to a point of comfort where they understand the options available to them in Vim, and can continue learning on their own as they go forward.</p>\n<p>Below is a collected page of the posts in the series:</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href="http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/">The Basics</a> - A quick look at getting started in Vim.
