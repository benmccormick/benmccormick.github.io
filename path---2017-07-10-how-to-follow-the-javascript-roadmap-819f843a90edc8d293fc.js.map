In this post I wanted to highlight a few of the resources I can recommend for keeping up with the language changes.</p>\\n<h3>Learning ES6/ES2015</h3>\\n<p>If you haven’t paid attention to any features that aren’t ready in all browsers yet, or you’re getting back to JavaScript development after being away for a while, you probably could use a resource to catchup on the ES6 JavaScript release from 2015.  ES6 is now <a href=\\\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\\\">almost completely</a> implemented in the latest versions of all major browsers, so if you’ve been ignoring it due to compatibility concerns, now is the time to learn.  Fortunately there are a lot of great resources for learning about ES6.  My favorite quick reference is the <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/\\\">Learn ES2015 page</a> from <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel</a>.  It’s a short, example filled page with explanations of all the major features of the language update. If you want something meatier, there have been several resources created by JS experts.  <a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/2tVcwaW\\\">Understanding ECMAScript 6</a> by <a href=\\\"https://www.nczonline.net/about/\\\">Nicholas Zakas</a> and <a href=\\\"http://exploringjs.com/es6.html\\\">Exploring ES6</a> by <a href=\\\"http://2ality.com/\\\">Axel Rauschmayer</a> are books that go through the new features in detail.  If you prefer video tutorials, <a href=\\\"http://wesbos.com/\\\">Wes Bos</a> has a <a href=\\\"https://es6.io/\\\">whole video course on ES6</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Keeping up with new features</h3>\\n<p>Things haven’t been changing as fast since the ES6 release.  The first 2 “annual releases” of the ECMAScript spec contained only a <a href=\\\"http://2ality.com/2016/01/ecmascript-2016.html\\\">combined</a> <a href=\\\"http://2ality.com/2016/02/ecmascript-2017.html\\\">8 features</a>. but there are still a lot of new features working their way through the ECMAScript pipeline.  If you want to get a quick overview of the features being considered for future releases, the best place to look is the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tc39/proposals\\\">TC39 proposals repo on Github</a>.  TC39 is the organization that guides the future of the ECMAScript spec.  Proposals go through a 4 stage process, where stage 1 can best be understood as “ideas”, and stage 4 is “confirmed for the next ECMAScript release”.  <a href=\\\"https://ponyfoo.com/contributors/ponyfoo\\\">Nicolás Bevacqua</a> put up a <a href=\\\"https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tc39-ecmascript-proposals-future-of-javascript\\\">good post</a> last week describing this process in depth, as well as giving a brief description of the more advanced proposals in the queue. If you’re interested in keeping up with new proposals but want somebody to walk you through them, I recommend subscribing to Axel Rauschmayer’s <a href=\\\"http://2ality.com/\\\">2ality</a> blog.  In addition to writing the ES6 book mentioned above, he regularly writes blog posts highlighting new proposals with detailed explanations of the feature implementation and motivation.</p>\\n<h3>Testing new features</h3>\\n<p>Almost all of the higher stage proposals on the TC39 list have been implemented by <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel</a> and you can try them out in the Babel <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&#x26;evaluate=true&#x26;lineWrap=false&#x26;presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-2&#x26;targets=&#x26;browsers=&#x26;builtIns=false&#x26;debug=false&#x26;code_lz=Q\\\">REPL</a> or by setting up a small project that loads in Babel.  </p>\\n<h3>Keeping up with the conversation</h3>\\n<p>If you’re a twitter user, probably the easiest way to keep up with language evolution is to follow the people who are shaping and teaching the new language features.
