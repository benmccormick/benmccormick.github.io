I'm switching to a modified version of the excellent [Object][object] theme by [gluttony][glutton] for this blog.  I like the cleaner content-focused look that it brings, and especially feel like it helps my code samples stand out.  I hope you like it.

My site continues to be generated as static pages by [octopress][octopress], and written using [Sublime Text][sublime].  Both are unreservedly recommended.
