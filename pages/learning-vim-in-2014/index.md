<div class="explanation">
Learning Vim in 2014 was a series of posts I wrote in July & August 2014 documenting a process for newcomers to learn Vim. It was inspired by my own experience learning Vim, running into many out of date resources and online resources that gave me just a quick list of tips, plugins or commands.

This is a “point in time” snapshot of one man's advice on how to learn Vim.  It is by no means comprehensive.  I covered some topics in depth, and only skimmed others.  But it's intended to get new Vim users to a point of comfort where they understand the options available to them in Vim, and can continue learning on their own as they go forward.

Below is a collected page of the posts in the series:

7. [Copy And Paste The Vim Way](http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/28/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way/) - Vim ignores modern copy and paste conventions in favor of it's own system, keybindings, and vocabulary.  This piece explains the method behind Vim's copy and paste madness.

8. [Search](http://benmccormick.org/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search/) -  Good search techniques, either for text or files, is one of the most important things you need when working with large code bases or documents.

### Acknowledgements

I'm heavily indebted to [Drew Neil](https://twitter.com/nelstrom) and [Wynn Netherland](http://wynnnetherland.com/). Drew's book [Practical Vim](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356980&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS) helped me to really understand Vim and influenced the posts above.  His [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) site also continues to be the best Vim resource on the internet.  Wynn's talk at BlendConf 2013 inspired me to get a deeper understanding of Vim, after being frustrated by trying to use it for a while without really understanding it.
