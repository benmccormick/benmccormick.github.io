I’ve talked with so many developers who have incredible enthusiasm for software development and the web platform.  If that’s you, I have a cool opportunity I want to share.</p>\n<p>I try to stay on-topic on this blog and don’t talk about myself very much, but last winter I joined <a href="http://www.windsorcircle.com">Windsor Circle</a>, a tech startup in Durham North Carolina. We’re a software as a service company focused on helping marketers retain their customers.  Since joining, it’s been a crazy ride.  Last April, we were selected as the winner of <a href="https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/the-tech-hub-network-demo-day/">Google’s “Tech Hub Demo Day”</a>, a competition where Google brought in 10 leading startups from around the country and gave them the opportunity to pitch to an auditorium full of Silicon Valley venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>This summer we followed that up by raising 6.5 million in Series B funding, and we’re now growing rapidly.  Part of that growth is building out our front end development team, and we have a Front End Developer position that is open now.</p>\n<p>I want to work with great people, so here’s my no BS pitch to any JavaScript developers out there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Come live (stay?) in Durham NC, get great weather, big city resources for small city cost of living, and amazing food <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work with a small but growing development team that has a good mix of senior and less experienced developers.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help build and shape an ambitious web app built with Backbone and Marionette.js on top of a Python backend</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work with a <a href="http://www.windsorcircle.com/team">team</a> that has a lot of fun while taking care of their work like professionals and places a genuine emphasis on the <a href="http://www.windsorcircle.com/about-us/our-values">company’s values.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can even get paid for all of this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, if you’re interested, we’re open to a mix of experience levels.
