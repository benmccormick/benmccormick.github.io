webpackJsonp([93837366247745],{757:function(t,e){t.exports={data:{markdownRemark:{html:"<p>Hi there,</p>\n<p>If you’re seeing this page, you’ve probably sent me an email or Linkedin message asking me about interest in a job you have available.  Thank you!  I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to me.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the past year I’ve started getting more recruiting emails than I have the time to respond to.  I don’t like leaving people hanging, it’s rude!  But many of the jobs that I’m sent aren’t in any way fits, and I’m blessed enough to have a job at the moment that I really love.  So it’s difficult for me to turn each email into a conversation, and hard to know which ones deserve more of a reply.</p>\n<p>Since I don’t want to waste your time or mine, I’ve come up with 5 quick questions that will help me know whether us talking more would be useful.  If this is extra work for you, feel free to ignore and move on with your day.  Like I said, I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What company is this job for?</strong> - I recognize as a recruiter you may be worried about losing leads, but I’m not going to follow up on any message that doesn’t include that specific information.</li>\n<li><strong>Where will I be expected to work?</strong> - I currently live in Durham, NC.  I’m not open to relocation at this time.  If that doesn’t fit with the job then we should probably both move on.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the job role?</strong> - Is this a leadership position?  Front End Developer, back end?  Contract/Full time?  I currently have a great position as a lead developer, and have no interest in roles that are not full time right now.  </li>\n<li><strong>Why did you contact me?</strong> - If the answer is because I showed up in your LinkedIn search, that’s fine.  I just like to know</li>\n<li><strong>What’s the approximate salary range for the job?</strong> - I recognize that this question is a bit more unusual and more of a problem for many folks, but the truth is I’m not going to be taking a job right now that doesn’t involve a reasonable raise.  So like the others, this is a way of making sure we don’t waste time.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you go through the time to read and respond to this, I will do my absolute best to make sure I respect that with time and attention of my own.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck in your search for candidates.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"A note to recruiters",keywords:null,category:null,date:"2015-06-04T13:42:18+00:00",path:"/a-note-to-recruiters",layout:"page",hideFooter:!0},fields:{slug:"/a-note-to-recruiters"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/a-note-to-recruiters",relatedPosts:[{path:"/404.html",data:{title:"",path:"/404.html",description:null,date:null}},{path:"/a-note-to-recruiters",data:{title:"A note to recruiters",path:"/a-note-to-recruiters",description:null,date:"2015-06-04T13:42:18+00:00"}},{path:"/about",data:{title:"About Me",path:"/about",description:null,date:null}}]}}}});
