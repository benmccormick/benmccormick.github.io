One of the commonly encountered uses of the term in technical fields is the phrase “Managing programmers is like herding cats” or “Managing engineers is like herding cats”. In education it would be “Managing students is like herding cats”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase correctly captures the difficulty of getting a group of programmers (or even worse <em>teams of programmers</em>) on the same page.  But there’s an inherent arrogance to it.  The implication is that the herder is the adult in the room and everyone else’s pointless individualism is getting in the way.</p>\n<p>There are days that I think I could fix everything if I could just get the *&#x26;$% cats to move in the right direction.  In those situations  I’ve started telling myself that what I’m actually doing is herding <strong>lions</strong>.  How do you herd a group of lions?  I have no idea.  But I know that if you don’t start with a healthy respect for the lion’s capabilities and agenda, it won’t end well for you.</p>\n<p>When you treat people like lions, it’s an opportunity to stop and figure out <em>why</em> they’re not just getting on board with your <em>obvious</em> plan.  It’s an opportunity to learn, to find new ways to motivate people, and maybe even to empower somebody who had been viewing themselves as more of a kitten.  Ultimately the best teams flourish where people can <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/\">be strong contributors, take risks and do work they find meaningful</a>.  They’re teams of lions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Herding Lions","keywords":"","category":"eng-management","date":"2019/05/27","path":"/2019/05/27/herding-lions","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2019/05/27/herding-lions"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/05/27/herding-lions","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2019/04/15/soft-skills","data":{"title":"Ten Soft Skills That Will Shape Your Career","path":"/2019/04/15/soft-skills","description":"The other 80% of career skills.","date":"2019/04/15","category":"soft-skills"}},{"path":"/2019/01/01/book-review-radical-candor","data":{"title":"Book Review: Radical Candor","path":"/2019/01/01/book-review-radical-candor","description":"The best book I read in 2018","date":"2019/01/01","category":"reviews"}},{"path":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things","data":{"title":"Obvious Things","path":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things","description":"Obvious things that I still end up learning over and over again","date":"2019/05/18","category":"soft-skills"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
