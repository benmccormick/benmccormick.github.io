Looks lightning fast, good looking and usable.  Exactly what you’d expect.  I’m not a big UI guy for Git, but I’ll be playing with this, and it might be my new go-to recommendation.</p>\n<h3>Book Review</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OqjY8u\">The Everything Store | Brad Stone</a></p>\n<p>Still finishing this one up, but can already recommend it.  A great look into the creation of one of the most important companies in the world.  I was pretty interested to read about how intense Jeff Bezos is, and how hard he ran the early employees of Amazon.  I hadn’t realized that he fell into the Steve Job’s school of CEO-hood.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: September 30","keywords":"","category":"opinion","date":"2018/09/30","path":"/2018/09/23/weekly-links-09-23-30/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/09/23/weekly-links-09-23-30/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/09/23/weekly-links-09-23-30/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
