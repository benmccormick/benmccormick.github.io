Is your work actually serving anyone who isn’t invested in your employer?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-doesnt-employ-anyone-in-san-francisco-but-now-we-pay-everyone-as-though-all-did-3ee87013cfc2\">Basecamp doesn’t employ anyone in San Francisco, but now we pay everyone as though all did | Basecamp</a> - On a similar vein, this is a tech employer holding themselves to a higher standard in terms of benefiting their employees<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.

Use bookmarks, type in URLs directly, basically go to sites directly for content instead of relying on social media algorithms to find stuff for you.  I think this is easier said than done.  Social networking sites are ingrained into our culture at this point. You don’t replace culture by condemning it, and telling everyone to go without but by creating something new or better<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.
