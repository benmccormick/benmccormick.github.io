So no more updates through the end of the year.  Will re-evaluate then and hopefully start things back up.  I have plans to take the weekly links stuff I’ve been doing the past year and turn it into a real email newsletter with a better template, and some exciting ideas for a new blog series.  But I lack the capacity to follow up on them for now.  So Happy Holidays in advance everybody, I hope to be back early next year.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pressing Pause","keywords":"","category":"meta","date":"2018/10/13","path":"/2018/10/13/pressing-pause/","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/10/13/pressing-pause/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/10/13/pressing-pause/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/","data":{"title":"Tips For Improving a Large Code Base With A Small Team","path":"/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/","description":"How do you keep improving things with limited resources?","date":"2018/01/07","category":"fe-architecture"}},{"path":"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/","data":{"title":"Ten Things A Serious JavaScript Developer Should Learn","path":"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/","description":"Some of the important things to pick up in the JS world","date":"2017-07-19T04:00:00+00:00","category":"javascript"}},{"path":"/2018/02/07/react-confessions/","data":{"title":"React Architecture Confessions","path":"/2018/02/07/react-confessions/","description":"The mistakes I made while learning React and why I made them","date":"2018/02/07","category":"fe-architecture"}}]}},
