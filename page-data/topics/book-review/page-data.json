Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.  Behind door number #1 lies a relatively rapid path to a “senior developer” role, followed by stagnation the rest of your career as you reimplement the same solutions in new technologies for minimally increasing pay over time, until youth-friendly tech culture decides that you’re too old to be useful.  Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 145.51495016611295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAdCAYAAACqhkzFAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAEs0lEQVRIx5VWa1NTVxTNL6qDWvCJIAqCPMXS8kZR8AEBhPAaGbBKreNoae2XdtqZTp2xrU5rreM4dtrm3NzcR25uEpIASvuhP2V17ZOHEsW2H1Zy7t37rLP26yQBY/8evAlqX8W261efSxFQB/biTTAO7Hu5PrgP2/mVImDsfAevYwcUvyO7y2AfOoBYbQ2cw4cQqdgFVZb32bUjB/oaZbk98j5gfHgFb8YSzOvLsFc+gfv5HTifrSB643rOdu0qjMWFHArPV5b0OhDObmJbZIj0C+J5Dmt/En9Bff8A6sdHUD8/gfr2HpSTQPjF3/R/wRzGUvhf+PJrqPs/IZxaR9jPQP0egVq5AxWOIuytkpAf2yKeLq6FQD39Der2CtS9H6Ce/QEV9aj0F6hPSXj3HsLJ9X8hLJAJsZA9YogffazJJHylbKgHD6Fu3tJKRXFAPt6K5BqU7UM9fkriTC5/39yF+uKrXPg3bkL9Gtb5k4MDKhrDW2HGcqE9fAz1HcmePIPq79Otonuvcj9TcB/KTUJFXBK2NOE/obUZqrlRw9jzbm5qZDr27IY6Uk17C21N7MPyXSiFykM/V+zeCrEVyIqkPKB8p7ZtGT3tsLdcj12EoUSqDsKsqYJJBRqHqxCprtS212a8MHrFlzL0nFnj6GGYHLdo3RFYx47C5tjZXGvw2SJxlKTiIzNuUIAq7CcCxRNEGTdHJiZgnWhF9NIE7Avn4XR9AFfQ+T5c5tHpOAmbdnNkBJGhIRgkflVpoCidp5m8ACxujF5egLW0BHtxEe7cHNyFBdi3bsPr7YIzPw+bh1mhEKJTUzBPtL1Uqa+vPLvJfFkS3tkzcPt64Tc1wB/oRWKgD8nTA4hPTyPZ2YFERzv81iat2qmvhSUpqqos5lQTRqguSoPDPDmDp+HOziJGJXGqiy8vI3VpHMnJCSRmpuFRudicq9dgB4OwG+oQZV71nVnIYYR5sI7WwG2ohUcF8Yvn4XNzamIM6dAksuNBrC5cRopIzs/Bnw7BC47CHT4L9/gxXahC5QMSv8lmtd5r12F4vd3wzw4iRdJ0cARZEq7PhLA2N6PXq1SaOj8Mn2Qe0yHFstrbYLIDjIJCs47t0d4K5xRz1c+8DZ1BcmoS6ekpZJcWscHLdoOX59r8LDKhKW1LsAO84SG4JLW6O2E2NuQJ2Ywm+0r6LCaFoNJkTxfSLMTahWE8Z7ibVLg5M4WNiaB+lz7dT59O+Cfb9B7pVSmqoX9TRKEQUrLLmY135AhXB08hw83rY6PYmBzXWB8bQYbhii1BH/F1Wxq5t1ZzFPtQF4WnuDzNY+g+85Lq79Eqs8NntCpBlnlLDw4g1dejfcTX4R7ZKxyq2IfSNjXVugVi7LG4kJLMHx9DavQiUlSZGgsiySIlWTCfhHEJl766bTjvxbYpbWyn+ThirJonFT83jPjIBfiCc0Os7BA8Vt9j4WIcP6exXu/R+Ss0dnH08sWx2Fe2zG13F2KsnsfKS3toUFmMuXNO9cPmNFn1dbncyU2TFxbY8ndD5llIZQQZitN0XCc91tasw5O1S1Vi08o4+4VQjdJZ3qKUIUherMLVJdeYXF3sV3kntkKblO7/ByXkzXwLyzGCAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/40f08/twtl.png 143w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/d4502/twtl.png 285w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"clean-architecture-book,react-confessions,large-improvements-small-team","topics":["architecture","book-review"],"category":"reviews","key":"philosophy-of-software-design-book","title":"Book Review: A Philosophy of Software Design","description":"A solid intermediate book on the art of writing software","layout":"review","path":"/2018/12/31/book-review-philosophy-of-software-design/","date":"2018/12/31","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>A lot of the software books out there these days are marching towards their expiration dates the day they’re written.  When I see titles like “Angular 2 Development”, “Learning JavaScript with React”, “Writing Native Apps with Ionic 2 and Lodash 4” I know that the book will soon have out of date code examples and will not contain the latest ways a community is using the libraries they’re discussing.  There is value in these types of books and they often represent a monumental amount of thought and time from their authors, but 5 years from now they will no longer be relevant.  I love reading books that I know will last.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Rpu6zX\">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout\">John Ousterhout</a> is a book that will last.  It’s full of timeless software writing advice that isn’t tied to a particular language, library or point of time.  Although not formally organized this way, it seems to be divided into ~4 parts: 2 chapters on the idea of complexity, a concept which Ousterhout uses as the unifying theme of the book, 8 chapters on what I’d describe as the structural design of software systems, 7 chapters on more “code level concerns” like naming conventions, comments and making code obvious, and then a final 2 chapters that feel a bit more like appendixes which discuss some common software trends and designing for performance.</p>\n<p>The best part of the book is those first few chapters where Ousterhout eloquently describes the problems that complexity can cause in a software project and lays out the distinction between a tactical and strategic approach to coding.  This is the heart of the titular <strong>philosophy</strong> of Software Design: the idea that software engineering is ultimately a fight against complexity.  It’s a strong vision clearly articulated.</p>\n<p>The “structural” sections of the book are all sound in an opinionated way.  The book makes an argument for larger implementations hidden behind smaller abstractions, which Ousterhout calls “deep modules”, and much of the structural section is through that lens.  This isn’t as open-minded as architecture advice I’ve seen elsewhere, but the benefit is that it’s prescriptiveness makes it much easier to use as a guide or code review tool than more situational or caveated advice.  That practical aspect is clearly a goal of the book, and the approach therefore makes sense.</p>\n<p>After chapter 11, the book takes a sudden detour from higher level concepts into much more concrete realms.  There is an extensive treatment of commenting style, naming conventions and other ways to make code readable and obvious.  There is a coherent through-line of building maintainable systems throughout, but the transition felt strange.  The content is still good though.</p>\n<p>The book ends on a chapter addressing modern software trends through the lens of the concepts considered in the book, which felt like a good place to wrap up, and then a chapter on designing for performance.  Given the books focus on complexity and the size of the performance topic, this chapter is content to argue that simple designs are friendly to performance, without trying to unpack many performance related topics.  It felt a bit tacked on to me, but it makes sense as a piece of objection handling for those who feel that they can’t simplify their architecture for performance reasons.</p>\n<p><em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is going to be my new go to recommendation for developers who are able to write code that runs but want to start thinking about how to write better code.  It doesn’t have the depth of something like <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/\">Clean Architecture</a>, but it is extremely readable and approachable, and I’ve never seen an architecture-level book that was so focused on actionable advice.  If you take the advice in the first chapter and consult the book during code reviews, every chapter in the book has something to consider when looking at a piece of non-trivial code.  That makes it a perfect introduction to higher-level software design thinking.

That focus serves it well, and I found it to be well worth my time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/design-systems/\">Design Systems</a>  are an organized toolkit for creating digital products.  They’re a set of elements, widgets, patterns, and layouts (atoms, molecules, organisms and templates in the language of the book) that can be combined to build complex sites and applications.  The idea is pretty simple.  But there are some real challenges in implementing one.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>What content belongs in a design system?  Where do we draw the boundary as to what belongs and what doesn’t?</em></li>\n<li><em>How do you build a tool for your design system so that patterns are easily findable, usable, and understandable?</em></li>\n<li><em>How do you keep a design system relevant over time as the product(s) change?</em></li>\n<li><em>How do you convince budget-conscious organizations that maintaining a design system is a good use of time and money?</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>After a brief introduction to the ideas behind design systems and pattern libraries, these are the challenges that Atomic design tackles.  It discusses a hierarchy for patterns, and methods for pulling them out of existing applications, then moves on to talking about tools for implementing a pattern library, and techniques for navigating organizational politics when starting and maintaining a design system.</p>\n<p>So this book <strong>will be helpful</strong> for you if you are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Struggling to deal with inconsistencies in your interfaces, or constantly doing custom UI work for each new feature</li>\n<li>Considering implementing a design system/pattern library for your organization</li>\n<li>Hoping to learn more about design systems because somebody else in your organization is pushing for one</li>\n<li>Having trouble maintaining an existing pattern library</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It <strong>won’t be helpful</strong> for you if you are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Looking for tips on how to make your interface beautiful</li>\n<li>Seeking hands on information about specific design, CSS or JavaScript techniques</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I enjoyed Atomic Design a lot, and hope that I’ll get to use what I’ve learned in the near future.

It did exactly what I want from a software book in 2018: it tackled an important high level topic with a great amount of depth in a way that helped me as a reader to develop insight and perspective on the topic.  These days blog posts and other online sources cover most of my “how to” needs, as well as the simple “what is X and why should I care about it” questions that I used to go to books for.  But there is still no substitute for books when you want an in depth understanding of an important broad topic.\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1516226851&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+architecture&linkCode=li2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=c599845decc4e5ed1457acae2a375ad6\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img border=\"0\" class=\"inline-img\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0134494164&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=benmccormicko-20\" ></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0134494164\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\nFor this book, that topic is software architecture.  The book tackles it by starting with some history, and then starting with a micro view before expanding out its gaze.  After giving a broad overview of the different software paradigms, Martin walks readers through 3 levels of architecture principles: class-level design principles, component-level component principles and system-level architecture principles.  At each level he shows the similarities between the lower level principles, as well as the unique concerns at each scale. Then he wraps it up with a case study example that shows the principles discussed throughout the book in action.</p>\n<p>I found Clean Architecture to be a great reminder of concepts I learned in school<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> that I didn’t properly appreciate at the time due to a lack of practical experience.  It brought home to me that while there are some architectural things I do pretty well right now, like keeping code separated enough that it only has one reason to change, there are other things that I don’t do well a lot of the time.  For me the biggest realization was how much grief I’ve caused myself the last few years from failing to keep high level policies from depending on low level details.  The book gave me a few new lenses to examine my decisions with, and definitely inspired me to spend more time taking a step back to see the big picture as I’m adding new features.</p>\n<p>For me, that sense of perspective was the biggest win, but if you’re looking for detailed “how tos”, there’s a decent amount of that as well.  Martin goes into details about how to arrange and refactor classes to create maintainable systems that are easy to change, as well as identifying patterns to look for that may be a sign of problems to come.  He goes pretty deep into the weeds with examples and class diagrams as he discusses creating proper system boundaries and pulls it all together with a nice case study example at the end.</p>\n<p>While I did find Clean Architecture extremely helpful overall, I do have some nitpicks.  The biggest for me personally is that while the book mentions dynamic languages like Ruby and Python a few times, it mostly does so in passing to say that the principles mention still apply, but may look different.  Since this is usually not expanded upon, and all of the examples given seem to assume static languages that provide abstract interfaces to classes, it is sometimes hard to see how the books principles should be applied to the dynamic languages that I use daily.  I would love to have seen more detail there.  Also, the final chapter of the book “The Missing Chapter” was a bit of an oddity.  It was written by a different author<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, framed issues that had already been covered differently, and came to some different conclusions than the rest of the book.  It was almost a counterpoint to the other parts of the book, which could have been interesting, but lacked an introduction or context to help explain its purpose.  Overall it left me a bit confused and ended the book on a discordant note rather than bringing the ideas together and focusing me on the important ideas.</p>\n<p>I can recommend <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mKoejo\">Clean Architecture</a> for anyone who wants to get better at thinking about the big picture when it comes to software systems, particularly if you haven’t already been exposed to any of the theory behind designing maintainable systems.  If you’re usually working in static languages on larger projects, I would double that recommendation, as you’ll be right in the book’s wheelhouse.  For those like me working with dynamic languages on web projects, it may be a bit more hit or miss, but it still is a great way to broaden your horizons and gain some new ways of thinking about the tradeoffs our work entails.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I was a Computer Science major, but if you weren’t exposed to theories of software architecture through a curriculum</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This was not obvious to me on first reading, I only went back and noticed the acknowledgement on the chapter page when I was confused by a 3rd person reference to the author.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"clean-architecture-book,large-improvements-small-team,react-confessions","topics":["book-review","design"],"category":"reviews","key":"inmates-book","title":"Book Review: The Inmates Are Running The Asylum","description":"Don't judge a book by its first few chapters","layout":"review","path":"/2018/04/11/book-review-inmates-are-running-the-asylum/","date":"2018/04/11","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz\">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>\n<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>\n<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>\n<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>\n<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>\n<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>\n<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>\n<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.

I’ve found that I enjoy this teaching style, I also loved <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KHf3Ps\">Death By Meeting</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KXOkxh\">The Goal</a>, which employee the same style.  The beauty of fables is the way they allow you to soak into a scenario, and connect it to your own experiences and relationships.  Then as the principles the author wants to teach unfold, they take advantage of those connections to spark ideas for application.  At least that’s the theory.</p>\n<p>The Five Dysfunctions is of course, about how teams go wrong.  I won’t spoil the contents too much, but ultimately, team failures aren’t about technique or distinct decisions, but human beings and how we relate to each other.  This book both clearly defines a set of those problems, and then gives concrete suggestions for improving a team when they’re present.  It’s a classic, and I found it as thought provoking as I expected.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to better understand how teams work, and how they fail.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/07/09/book-review-five-dysfunctions/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"mn-series,backbone-devs-react,bb-radio","topics":["backbone","javascript","book-review"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Building Backbone Plugins","description":"A book review of a great deep dive into Backbone best practices","layout":"review","path":"/2014/07/09/understanding-the-backbone-mindset-a-review-of-building-backbone-plugins-by-derick-bailey","date":"2014-07-09T11:38:40+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>As the saying goes, judging a book by its cover is a dangerous business.  A lot of books have titles that promise great things, and content that under-delivers and disappoints.  Every once in a while, though, you find a gem that does the opposite. <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> sounds like a niche book for library developers.  But it actually is the best resource on <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.JS</a> development I’ve found, a book that will benefit anyone who works with Backbone.</p>\n<p>So what’s the fuss about?  The book’s author, Derick Bailey, is the creator of <a href=\"http://marionettejs.com/\">Marionette.JS</a>, a popular application framework for Backbone Apps.  <em>Building Backbone Plugins</em> explores the problems that Derick tried to solve with Marionette and then explains the mindset behind Marionette’s solutions.  It is not a book exclusively about Marionette though.  The solutions in the book are example code that represents a simplified view of what Marionette does.  Instead the book looks at the common problems any developer will encounter in a Backbone project, and provides a possible solution, while working hard to generalize the lessons and concepts as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Building Backbone Plugins is divided into 4 parts.  The first two look at Backbone Views and dealing with the DOM.  The third looks at Models and Collections.  The last part deals with application structure and events.  These are followed by a series of appendices that read as stretched-out blog posts on a variety of related topics that didn’t quite fit into one of the 4 buckets that the rest of the book falls into.</p>\n<p>In my mind, the first two parts are the heart of the book.  They’re a step-by-step look at how you can remove repetitive code from your Backbone Views and structure your application to expose the developers intent in each file, rather than burying the purpose in boilerplate. I learned a lot about how I could improve my Backbone code, and these two sections actually inspired me to start integrating Marionette into a project at work. The application structure advice in the fourth part is also particularly strong, with quality information about events, and ideas on how to scale a Backbone application beyond TodoMVC sizes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the appendices feel a bit tacked on, and seem to be full of stuff the author wanted to add but couldn’t figure out how to weave into the rest of the book.  Since it’s legitimate content rather than simply greater detail on things that have been already covered, they don’t act as real appendices and leave the book feeling a bit unfocused at the end. When you combine that with some weaker content in part 3 (where the author moves away from Marionette into some other smaller examples), the book can feel a bit choppy and directionless.  But the goldmine of knowledge and perspective in Parts 1, 2 and 4 more than make up for it.</p>\n<p>I would not recommend BBP as a “first book” on Backbone.  It assumes plenty of knowledge, and doesn’t attempt to teach Backbone basics.  But for an intermediate level Backbone developer, or any Javascript developer who wants to grow their thinking about application structure, there is plenty of solid insight here. Meditations on handling nested views, cleaning up unused views, abstracting out repetitive boilerplate, and structuring genuinely large applications are all worth the price of the book.  Finally, if you’re writing code using Marionette already, this book is a must-have.  Marionette’s documentation does a great job of explaining the “what” and the “how” of Marionette.  But this book explains the all-important “why” of a framework that is based on encoding Backbone best practices into a library. It will help you think like an experienced Backbone developer.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> - You can purchase the book on leanpub.

That was me reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SABeXz\">Radical Candor</a> by Kim Scott this summer.  It’s a ~200 page masterpiece on communication, leadership and being real at work.  The ideas in Radical Candor have already been a huge help to me as I’ve transitioned into a manager role over the past few months, and I fully expect to refer back to them a lot in the years to come.  It was the best thing I read in 2018, so I wanted to write a quick review to start the new year.</p>\n<p>Radical Candor is split into 2 parts: part 1 is philosophical, and builds out a philosophy of working with and managing people that’s based on honest guidance and feedback backed by genuine care.  The second half of the book is tactical and focused on techniques that managers can use to implement the philosophical ideas.  Overall it is a book for managers, but is also relevant and useful for anyone who has a manager or who wants to work better with others in a professional setting.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-img\">\n    <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/acd45/candor-diagram.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 90.35211267605634%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Radical Candor diagram\" title src=\"/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/a9e6e/candor-diagram.png\" srcset=\"/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/40f08/candor-diagram.png 143w,\n/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/d4502/candor-diagram.png 285w,\n/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/a9e6e/candor-diagram.png 570w,\n/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/c2e96/candor-diagram.png 855w,\n/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/f4f98/candor-diagram.png 1140w,\n/static/99fcbb54afd2343a252ea238c5f977e3/acd45/candor-diagram.png 2840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p>The heart of the book is the 2x2 grid diagram that Scott sprinkles throughout the chapters, showing the 4 quadrants that can characterize an interaction, relationship or communication style.  People who don’t care about those they work with and also don’t challenge them fall into manipulative insincerity and should be avoided at all costs.  The Steve Jobsian category of Obnoxious Aggression is when somebody is willing to challenge directly but doesn’t care about the people they’re challengin. To Scott’s mind, Obnoxious Aggression is preferred over Ruinous Empathy; when people who hate the idea of hurting somebody so much that they fail to tell them important truths.  But the target quadrant is Radical Candor, a state where you deal with people in a way that is backed by real humanity while still being willing to be exceptionally honest and challenging.</p>\n<p>This core idea wasn’t super new to me, I had seen it formulated in Church contexts as <code class=\"language-text\">Grace + Truth = Growth</code> in the past.  But Scott puts in the work to show how these ideas play out in a wide variety of professional situations and relationships, and her examples left me teeming with new ideas on how to interact better with my coworkers.  The theme is good, but the implementation ideas and little nuggets of wisdom and experience sprinkled throughout are better.  As a result, Radical Candor is one of the best books on relationship and communication I have ever read.</p>\n<p>I would recommend it for anyone who</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Manages people</li>\n<li>Wants to manage people</li>\n<li>Has a manager</li>\n<li>Has to deal with people</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do yourself a favor and check it out.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/01/01/book-review-radical-candor"}}}],"topic":"book-review"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
