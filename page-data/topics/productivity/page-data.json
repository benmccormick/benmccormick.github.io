In the end though it ended up becoming my single purpose editor for all occasions. Writing code, blogging, diffs, and reading logs all go through vim.  So why do I use Vim?</p>\n<h4>More Efficient Movement and Editing</h4>\n<p>This is the first thing you hear about from experienced Vimmers, and its an important one.  Once you have your feet under you as a Vim user, you are just able to edit faster.  This can be hard to understand before using Vim (or other keyboard based tools).  Using a mouse doesn’t feel particularly inefficient, and when you start out, Vim’s keyboard mappings can feel arbitrary, unintuitive and slow.  This is one of those times where a little work is needed to get the proper perspective.  Once you’ve had time to learn the basics, even a mediocre typist like me <sup id=\"fnref:1\">\n<a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> can fly when editing by typing smarter not harder.  This isn’t a tutorial on the basics of Vim, but the keys for me were understanding Vim was <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118\">a language in its own right</a>, and the biggest gains in Vim come when you create repeatable options to eliminate inefficiencies. These can be macros, but can also be as simple as using Vim’s easy control for repeating the last action<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>.  Vim is a huge toolbox of small tools that you can use together to create a powerful workstation.</p>\n<h4>Rich Plugin Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Like many things in Vim, the value of its plugin system wasn’t immediately obvious.  Unlike Sublime, which has a community consensus primary package manager and repository, Vim has multiple package managers that pull packages from a variety of locations<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>.  So you need to do some research to figure out what you should be using<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup> and find the right plugins.  But when you do, you’ll find that Vim has fantastic plugins for key tasks like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">fuzzy file search</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">syntax checking</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">in-file search</a>.  It also has a rich depth of plugins for pretty much every language/framework/functionality in common usage, as well as some great plugins that extend Vim’s built in motion/editing language.</p>\n<h4>Long Term Security</h4>\n<p>This one is a judgement call, but from my point of view, Vim is the safest investment of my time out there.  It has a rich open source community, one that has shown that its willing to try <a href=\"http://neovim.org/\">some big ideas</a> to keep from getting stale.  It’s had a great 20 years of usage and doesn’t appear to be in decline.  Sublime Text meanwhile, regrettably seems to be in danger of heading down a similar path to Textmate, with a single developer who has done great work, but <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#x26;t=14591\">doesn’t appear to be interested</a> in being involved in all of the different work that a software business requires.  I don’t think open source is the only way to rely on software<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>, but for general purpose text editors, Vim seems the safest bet to still be around in 10 years.</p>\n<h4>My Brain is Broken Now</h4>\n<p>This is a warning as much as a reason for using Vim, but I’ve quickly found that I’m no longer able to use Sublime or other editors without being frustrated by the fact that they’re not Vim.  Many editors, including Sublime, provide support for a large subset of Vim’s key bindings and modal controls.  But they all fall down at random places.  The power of vim doesn’t lie in one specific functionality, but the composable nature of their different options.  When some of them aren’t there, all the others are weakened, and my trained brain falls out of high efficiency mode into slow plodding “think through every keystroke mode.”  So don’t say I didn’t warn you.  Vim will break your brain.</p>\n<p>Those are the primary reasons I use Vim now.  There are a few things I haven’t loved though.</p>\n<h4>Vim’s UI is uglier than Sublime Text.</h4>\n<p>I’m a front end developer, used to working with, and working to create, beautiful interfaces.  Vim is not beautiful.  It looks like exactly what it is, a text based program with a lineage reaching back to the 70s.  It doesn’t handle margins or padding well, doesn’t have pretty autocomplete menus or visual alerts.  If you use it in the terminal you may be severely restricted in your color options, and this situation is not something that is going to change anytime soon<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup>.  I still love Sublime Text’s UI.  Nice margins, smooth scrolling, the ability to set different font and syntax highlighting options on a filetype basis are all nice gems that Vim just doesn’t offer.  I’ve come to appreciate Vim’s minimalism, but would love to see if Neovim were to offer a way to beautify some of these things.</p>\n<h4>Vim is harder to learn than it should be.</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some Vimmers object to this (its a power user tool, etc.) but the truth is, when pretty much every Vim tutorial starts by telling you that you should start by changing a bunch of the default settings, it becomes clear that learning Vim is harder than it should be. There’s no reason that basics like line numbers and syntax highlighting shouldn’t be turned on by default.  Configurability is great, but if you start out in a user-hostile state, many people won’t take the time to find the power.  There have been some efforts to change that.  Neovim seems to be actively rethinking this stuff, and projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> aim to help people get started with a richer initial setup.  But the very existence of these reforms points to the fact that Vim shoots itself in the foot with defaults that may have made sense in the eighties, but appear archaic next to modern competitors.</p>\n<p>For now I’m enjoying the Vim experience.  Despite a few warts, I really do think its the best text editor you can use today, and I’m excited to see where it goes in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\nI was never taught to type correctly growing up.

Instead of teaching you how Vim works, they toss a bunch of scary looking code at you, tell you to shove it in a file, and claim that it will make Vim just like Textmate / Sublime / Emacs / Visual Studio. Except way cooler!  People quickly find out that if what they want is to use their old editor, they should just <em>use their old editor</em>, and learn to use it as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>While writing about Vim the last few weeks, I’ve avoided recommending any configuration changes, other than the quick <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">sanity vimrc</a> I recommended in the first article, because I think it’s important to learn what sets Vim apart before trying to configure it.  Not because it’s good enough without configuration (honestly it’s not), but because once you understand the core, you can use configuration to build a great version of Vim instead of trying to hack together a Rube-Goldberg Textmate clone. But now that I’ve covered some of the basics (and if you haven’t yet, feel free to go ahead and start at <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">the beginning</a>), it’s time to look at Vim configuration.</p>\n<h3>Basic Configuration</h3>\n<p>Configuration for Vim starts with a vimrc file. It’s a text file located by default at <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vimrc</code> on *nix systems, and <code class=\"language-text\">$VIM\\_vimrc</code> on Windows.  To begin configuration you need to open that file, creating it if it doesn’t exist. But before we go further, we should stop and figure out what we’re doing.</p>\n<p>I said that configuration starts with the vimrc file, but the truth is that your vimrc is just a normal text file that Vim sources by default.  The heart of Vim configuration is Vimscript, Vim’s custom scripting language.  Vimscript is a full programming language, with variables and control structures.  But for this article we’re going to focus on using it for configuration.</p>\n<p>The basic commands that Vimscript uses for configuration are <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">set</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">let</code> allows you to change a variable value with the syntax <code class=\"language-text\">let &lt;var-name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">set</code> allows you to read or change an option value using <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;</code> for toggle options or <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;=&lt;option-value&gt;</code> for numeric or string-based options. <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> and its many variations allow you to create new keymappings by setting the output of one key combination to produce the value of another key combination.  You can use variations on map to specify how a key sequence should behave in different vim modes.</p>\n<h3>Know what you’re configuring</h3>\n<p>Now that you know the basic commands, I could show you an example .vimrc, explain it a bit and then tell you to copy it, change the stuff you don’t like, and go on your way.  The problem with that? It leaves your vimrc file as a “pile of junk”, that I understand and you don’t.   If I did a good job, you might understand the purpose of individual lines, but they probably wouldn’t be the best fit for you, and you probably wouldn’t know exactly how to make it better.  In the end you’ll keep tossing junk onto it until it becomes a confusing mess you want to avoid.  So instead, I’m going to walk through the types of configurations you might want to consider, give a few examples, and let you build from there.  So here are a few concepts to think about as you construct your vimrc file:</p>\n<h4>Adapt to your environment</h4>\n<p>Vi and Vim were originally developed in a low-resource terminal based environment.  Many of their default settings and assumptions reflect that.  Today though Vim is used in a wide variety of ways, from multimonitor Mac Pros with 16+GB of memory running multiple MacVim windows, to low memory remote servers running Vim in the terminal over ssh.  If you know what your environment will look like, you can optimize Vim for your own use.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you’re running in a high resource environment, (and pretty much any modern laptop or desktop these days qualifies as a high resource environment) you may want to enable some features that Vim disables by default, since those removing those features allow it to work well in very low memory situations.  Some  common choices:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable &quot; Turn on syntax highlighting\nset hidden &quot; Leave hidden buffers open\nset history=100 &quot;by default Vim saves your last 8 commands.  We can handle more</code></pre></div>\n<p>On the other hand, if you know you’re going to be running remotely on low resource machines, you might choose to disable those options to minimize the load and increase speed. I’ll talk more about plugins in a later post, but they’re another thing that works much better in your local environment than on remote servers, for both performance and logistical reasons.</p>\n<h4>Add some visual niceties</h4>\n<p>If we’re honest, I think most people can agree Vim is pretty hard to look at out of the box.  Very few visual affordances, no syntax highlighting or line numbers, and it’s style is dependent on your terminal color scheme or an ugly default gVim theme. But that’s pretty easy to fix. We can get syntax highlighting and line numbers with this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable\nset number</code></pre></div>\n<p>Getting a decent color scheme will require you to download it as a plugin, but if you’ve done that or if you like one of the colorschemes that ship with your Vim distribution it’s easy to set up with <code class=\"language-text\">colorscheme &lt;theme-name&gt;</code>.  Beyond that, there’s plenty more you can do to improve the visual feel of Vim.  I’d look into customizing your status bar, relative vs absolute line numbers, and plugins like <a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Vim-Thematic</a>.</p>\n<h4>Set up keybindings</h4>\n<p>Many of Vim’s useful commands are either not given default keybindings, or are given hard to remember obtuse ones.  Don’t want to spend your whole life typing <code class=\"language-text\">source ~/.vimrc</code> into each file everytime you add something to your configuration? I shortcut that to <code class=\"language-text\">\\rr</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">map &lt;leader&gt;rr :source ~/.vimrc&lt;CR&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>You might be wondering what the <leader> notation is there.  The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;leader&gt;</code> key is a Vim convention for a key that comes before user created keystrokes.  It’s meant to minimize conflicts, and allow plugins to provide default mappings while still allowing the user a bit of flexibility.  The leader key can be set in your vimrc with the command <code class=\"language-text\">let mapleader=&lt;yourleaderkey&gt;</code>.  The default is <code class=\"language-text\">\\</code>, and I would recommend leaving it that way to start.  You can change it later if you find it to be inconvenient, and it doesn’t cause any conflicts since its the default key.  Common replacements like <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> overwrite useful functionality that may not be immediately obvious (<code class=\"language-text\">,</code> allows you to move backwards on a characterwise search for instance).</p>\n<h4>Configure plugins and file-type specific settings</h4>\n<p>I’ll touch more on plugins in a future post, but many of them allow extensive configuration, including setting keybindings, changing default behaviors, and enabling/disabling extra functionality. All of that happens here in the vimrc and should mostly use the let/set/map commands that we’ve already seen.</p>\n<p>You can also set file-type specific rules.  Rather than placing these in your main vimrc, these go into a special “file type plugins” directory, <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vim/ftplugin</code>.  Within that directory, you can create files like javascript.vim, python.vim or html.vim, and those files will be loaded after the vimrc when you open files of that type. Using those files, you can create completely separate profiles for each file type.</p>\n<h3>Discover what’s out there</h3>\n<p>I’ve intentionally avoided telling you what your vimrc should look like here.  I’ve tried to show you the big picture of what you can do, and now I’ll leave it to you to figure out what pieces you need to be comfortable and productive.  It will be different for everybody.</p>\n<p>My advice?  Now that you know what you’re looking for, go and take a look at other people’s configurations. Start with something like this <a href=\"https://github.com/benmccormick/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">vimrc boilerplate</a>, and add the things you like.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to find good configurations online if you look.  <a href=\"https://github.com/ben336/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">My vimrc file</a> is on Github.  It’s certainly not the best out there, but its relatively small and easy to follow.  If you know developers you admire who use Vim, ask to see their vimrc files, or see if they have any fancy tricks to share.  For those without those resources,  Github’s <a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">dotfile page</a> is a great place to look.  It contains links to several very detailed “dotfile repos” from various developers. You don’t have to copy everything from these files (in fact you shouldn’t), but you can pull the things that look useful, get rid of things that don’t, and try things out as you slowly build up your own workspace, built to do the jobs that you need it to do.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">Github’s dotfile page</a> provides some great pointers to dotfile repositories from experienced developers that can help you come up with cool configuration ideas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> is a great resource for users who’d prefer to avoid configuration and just start with a useable editor.  Though if that’s you, you may find you’re better off <a href=\"http://delvarworld.github.io/blog/2013/03/16/just-use-sublime-text/\">just using Sublime Text</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/07/14/learning-vim-in-2014-configuring-vim"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["vim","productivity"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Copy and Paste the Vim Way","description":"How to use copy and paste in Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/07/27/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way","date":"2014-07-27T23:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>If you’ve been following <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/tag/learning-vim-in-2014/\">my series on Vim</a>, it should be clear now that Vim has a pretty clear philosophy of how text editing should work. It’s based on the Unix philosophy of small composable tools, and doesn’t necessarily match up with the conventions that other editors use for common commands.  So it’s probably not surprising that Vim has its own way of handling copy and paste operations, and in fact doesn’t even use those terms.  Vim’s copy and paste handling is minimalist, composable, and powerful, but most people take some time to adjust to it.  I’m going to walk through the basics here, along with a few advanced features that are worth knowing about.</p>\n<p>The primary Vim commands for copying something are <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> (yank) which acts like most people’s view of copy, and the delete/substitute commands <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> (delete),<code class=\"language-text\">c</code> (change), <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> (single character delete), and <code class=\"language-text\">s</code> (substitute), which unintuitively all act like the more common concept of “cut”.  These can be <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">composed with motion commands to select different regions</a>.  </p>\n<p>Any Vim command that deletes text will also save a copy of that text unless you specifically tell it not too.  The idiomatic Vim method of deleting without copying is <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code>, which probably sounds bizarre.  We’ll come back to that later, and you’ll see that it makes sense in the bigger scheme of Vim’s copy and paste system.</p>\n<p>The basic Vim commands for paste are <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> (put) which pastes after of the current character/line and <code class=\"language-text\">P</code> which pastes before the current character/line.  Vim auto detects whether you’ve yanked text on a line by line basis or a character by character basis, and pastes accordingly. Basically, if you select only full lines it will paste line by line and not break on the cursor position, if you select any partial lines it will paste at the character level, starting or ending at the current cursor location.  Note that <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> also works in visual mode, where it will replace the current selection.</p>\n<p>All of this leads to a very common annoyance for new Vim users.  They’re editing a document and yank some text.  Then they go to a new location, delete a few lines, and hit <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> to replace them with the copied text.  Do you see the problem?  The text that is “put” is not what they originally yanked, but instead it’s the contents of their last delete action. Obviously this can be worked around by changing the order of the actions, but it’s frustrating to users who are used to being able to easily delete without blowing away their paste action.  Even more frustrating is when an experienced Vim user comes by and tells them the answer to their problem is to just type <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;0p</code> instead. Which will in fact put the correct text. So what’s going on with the weird syntax for these basic action?</p>\n<h4>Registers</h4>\n<p>What we’re missing is a clear understanding of how Vim handles copy and paste operations.  So let’s clarify.  Unlike most modern systems, which have a clipboard that holds a single value, Vim can store the values of yank and delete commands in one of many registers.  It has 26 normal registers, which correspond to the letters of the alphabet, and several “special” registers.  One of those special registers is the default register, which is where yank and delete commands store their content by default.  Other registers can be accessed with the <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;&lt;char&gt;</code> prefix that we’ve already seen.  So in the above example, the text from the initial example is moved into the default register, and then replaced there by the deleted text.  But it remains in the 0 register, which always points to the last “yanked” text, ignoring text gained by deleting.</p>\n<p>The 26 alphabetical registers serve as great “medium term” storage.  You can use them to yank something that you want to have around for a while, and then put it in a few different places, even if you’re yanking and deleting other things in the meantime.  These will even persist across sessions as long as you have the <code class=\"language-text\">nocompatible</code> option set in your vimrc file.  However if you overwrite one, there’s no easy way to get it back.  </p>\n<p>One cool feature of registers is the built in ability to append to the end of them.  If you want to add text to an existing register, for instance if you missed part of the text you wanted to yank, you can do so by capitalizing the register.  So if you had deleted a line and put it in the <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;add</code>, but meant to include a second line, you could then delete the next line and append it to the register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Add</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ap</code> would then put the 2 lines back into the document.</p>\n<h4>Special Registers</h4>\n<p>In addition to the alphabetical registers, there are several <em>special registers</em> that are worth knowing about.  I already mentioned the default register, which most Vim users know about, even if they don’t understand exactly how registers work.  Other important registers are the clipboard register, the black hole register, and the numbered registers.</p>\n<p>If you have to learn one special register, learn the clipboard register.  One of the first things people notice about copy and paste in Vim is that it doesn’t interact nicely with other applications’ copy and paste by default.  If you yank a line of text in Vim, it’s not added to the system clipboard.  If you copy some code from Stack Overflow and try to paste it in Vim with <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>, it won’t work <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.  But, since we know about registers, it makes sense that the default register might not be mapped to the clipboard, which we don’t want getting blasted away everytime we delete a character.</p>\n<p>Vim isn’t completely disconnected from the system clipboard though.  The clipboard register <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> is Vim’s proxy to your system clipboard.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+y&lt;motion&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+p</code> act like traditional copy and paste.  Your version of Vim does have to be compiled with clipboard support in order to use the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> register. You can check to see if you have clipboard support with <code class=\"language-text\">:echo has(&#39;clipboard&#39;).</code><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> On OSX you can use MacVim to get clipboard support, since the default version of Vim shipped with OSX is not compiled with it.  On other operating systems you’ll have to investigate the easiest way to install with clipboard support if your version doesn’t have it.  It should be enabled for most modern mainstream distributions.</p>\n<p>Another register to quickly note is the black hole register <code class=\"language-text\">_</code>.  The black hole register, as you would expect, doesn’t retain what’s passed to it.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_y</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_p</code> are no-ops, and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code> is “true delete”, as opposed to the delete commands default “cut” like behavior.  Of course since most people don’t use all 26 alphabetical registers, you can also achieve effective true delete by deleting to any unused register.</p>\n<p>Finally, the number keys also have special register functionality.  You can’t yank text directly to a numbered register.  Instead the <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> register contains the last yanked text, and the <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> through <code class=\"language-text\">9</code> registers contain the last 9 deleted chunks of text.  This feature is a cool idea, but unfortunately the implementation is inconsistent and a bit weird.  For one thing the distinction between yanked and deleted text seems arbitrary, and since they act the same in other ways, puts an added cognitive load on the user to remember which one they used.  Secondly, for whatever reason, deletions that span less than a line get special behavior.  If you delete these to an alphabetical register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code> just like any other delete.  But if you delete them to the default register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;-</code> and not put in <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code>.  The logic is complicated enough that the numbered registers become tough to use in day to day tasks, and I’ll have to agree with Drew Neil in labeling them one of Vim’s <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/\">“bad parts.”</a></p>\n<h4>Macros</h4>\n<p>One last important thing to know about registers is that along with being used for copy and paste, they serve as a place to save macros, Vim’s reusable command language.  You can save a macro by typing <code class=\"language-text\">q&lt;register key&gt;&lt;commands&gt;q</code>, and the macro will be saved to the register.  Like yank and delete, capitalizing the register name will let you append to the register instead of replacing it. So there’s a few things you should know about that.  One, if you use macros, don’t save macros to the same registers that you use for copy and paste.  If you use the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> register a lot for the convenience of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;yy&lt;motion&gt;</code>, don’t use <code class=\"language-text\">qy</code> to save your macro unless you’re ok with it being blown away by your next yank.  Two, the sharing of registers allows you to copy text to use as a macro.  So if you for instance wanted to have a file with a list of common operations, it would be easy to go to that file, copy a line, and then execute it as a macro.  This isn’t the first thing most people will want to do, but it illustrates the power and flexibility that come when you start combining Vim’s tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a more in depth look at Vim’s special registers, including a bunch I didn’t cover here, you can check out this great <a href=\"http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/advanced-vim-registers/\">roundup</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/categories/copy-and-paste/\">Vimcasts</a> has a whole series of posts on copy and paste in Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Of course some people would probably see that as a feature, not a bug\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2\">\n        <p>\n        Thanks to schweinschmeisser on Reddit for reminding me to add a way to check for support.\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/07/27/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["vim","productivity"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Getting More from Vim with Plugins","description":"How plugins fit into a Vim workflow","layout":"post","path":"/2014/07/21/learning-vim-in-2014-getting-more-from-vim-with-plugins","date":"2014-07-21T10:50:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>It’s impossible to design a tool that fits everyone’s workflow perfectly.  No matter how many cases you hit, somebody will want to do something you don’t support, will find your solution for their problem confusing, or they’ll try to use your tool in a way you never imagined. Vim tries to deal with situations like that in 2 ways.  First by making it easy to <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/14/learning-vim-in-2014-configuring-vim/\">configure</a>, and second by making it easy to extend.

They’re a powerful tool, and a key part of what has helped Vim remain relevant for 23 years, even as the computing world has changed dramatically around it.  They allow Vim to support languages that didn’t exist the last time its core was updated, handle niche use cases that would never get solutions in the main Vim distribution, and also allow for powerful new features that benefit all users.</p>\n<p>Your key focus when it comes to Vim plugins should be identifying your needs and finding plugins to fit them.  Don’t just toss every plugin you see recommended somewhere into your .vim/bundle folder.  Plugins have costs; they slow down file loads, can fill up the key mapping space, and add complexity for users.  But they’re also extremely powerful, and I recommend that everyone who controls their development environment think about using at least a few.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Management: Hello Vundle</h3>\n<p>Before you install anything, you’re going to need a strategy for managing your plugins.  Plugin management for Vim has a bit of a troubled history.  There’s never been an official plugin management solution, and unlike Sublime Text’s Package Control, there wasn’t a simple, easy to use solution that the community standardized.  Instead, plugins were initially just placed into the .vim folder or elsewhere and then sourced in ~/.vimrc.  To allow for download or installation, authors used a variety of compression formats, including a Vim specific Vimball format.  Early efforts to standardize a process didn’t go particulary well.</p>\n<p>That changed with the rise of Github and Tim Pope’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a>.  Pathogen was the first plugin manager to make it relatively simple to include new plugins, by encouraging a standard directory format and installation process (using git repositories).  It began a standardization process that now means pretty much any modern Vim plugin can be installed with Pathogen without modification.</p>\n<p>Despite Pathogen’s historical significance, in 2014 you should use <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Vundle</a>, not Pathogen, to manage your plugins.  Vundle is an easy to use plugin manager that is compatible with the Pathogen format.  Vundle improves on Pathogen in several ways.  It allows you to list the plugins you want to use in your vimrc file, then will pull them down and install them for you.  So adding and removing plugins is just a configuration change, and it’s always easy to see which ones you’re currently using.  It makes it easy to pull plugins from a variety of sources, but optimizes for Github, and Vim.org.  Since roughly 99% of plugins that most users will need are available from one of those sources, this is extremely convenient.  You can find full documentation for using Vundle in its <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Github repo</a>, but trust me, it’s the best option out there for 99% of users.</p>\n<h3>What Can Plugins do for you?</h3>\n<p>Before you start installing plugins, it’s worth thinking about what you need from them.  There are a few main purposes for using plugins.  I’m including a few examples of each to get you started as you figure out which plugins make sense for you.</p>\n<h4>Let Vim Get Your Files In Order</h4>\n<p>File management plugins are some of the most important plugins you can use with Vim.  Vim’s built-in file management is pretty weak in some ways compared to editors like Sublime Text and TextMate.  Plugins can fill that gap.  The plugins listed below show several approaches to file management.  There’s plenty of overlap in functionality here, but they’re all worth trying to see which ones fit your style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is probably my most used Vim plugin.  It provides fuzzy finding capabilities for Vim, to allow you to search for files in a similar way to Sublime Text’s “Go To Anything” bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rking/ag.vim\">Ag.vim</a> are plugins to connect Vim with Ack and Ag respectively.  If you’re not using one of these tools for code search, you <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">really should be</a>.  They’re much faster than grep or an IDE’s built in search.  These plugins provide seamless integration for each within Vim, allowing you to easily jump to the code you’re searching on, opening new tabs or splits if you like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite.vim</a> is an interesting attempt to combine the functionality of plugins like ctrlp, ack.vim and others into a single “omnisearch” interface.  I personally found it a bit unintuitive and poorly documented, but some people <a href=\"http://www.codeography.com/2013/06/17/replacing-all-the-things-with-unite-vim.html\">swear by it</a>. If you are able to make sense of it, it’s certainly a great concept to pull in related functionality into a single interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is one of the most popular Vim plugins out there.  It provides a more traditional side-drawer style navigation interface to complement Vim’s other navigation options.  I personally prefer a “search over specifying” navigation style, so ctrlp and ack.vim work better for me.  But I keep NERDTree around for looking at other people’s code in new projects, when I want to look around a directory to see what’s available and how it’s structured before diving in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist\">Projectionist.vim</a> is something I’ve just begun to look into.  It’s an interesting approach by Tim Pope to provide a more intuitive way to navigate structured projects.  Rather than fuzzy finding or sidebars, Projectionist invites you to create categories of files that you can open files from (for instance  model, view and controller files in a BackboneJS project).  This gives you the simplicity of traditional Vim file path opens while removing some of the memorization and clutter from the process.  Projectionist also allows you to specify alternate files for each file. That allows you to, for instance, jump quickly from a file to its unit test file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Building On Vim’s Built In Language</h4>\n<p>Another interesting class of Vim plugins are plugins that extend Vim’s existing language concepts.  In my past few posts I’ve looked at how Vim is intended to be used by <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">combining composable commands with motions and text objects</a>, then efficiently <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">repeating that process when possible</a>.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround\">Surround.vim</a> is another plugin by Tim Pope.  It provides an extra command to use with Vim’s built in text objects. That command, <code class=\"language-text\">ys</code> allows you to surround a text object with some sort of enclosing tag. So <code class=\"language-text\">ysiw&#39;</code> surrounds the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">ysip&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</code> surrounds the current paragraph with <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags.  There’s also a separate command to replace surrounding characters with different ones.  It’s extremely useful, especially for HTML editing and quoting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary\">commentary.vim</a> adds a “commenting” action, <code class=\"language-text\">gc</code> that can be used with existing motions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">gcc</code> comments out the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">gcG</code> comments out the remainder of a file, and so on.  This is yet another Tim Pope plugin.  I promise I’m not trying to make up for recommending Vundle over Pathogen, the guy has just been prolific.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat\">Repeat.vim</a> is one final Tim Pope plugin for now.  Repeat allows you to extend the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command to work with user created commands.  It works with surround and commentary out of the box, but you can also set it up to work with your own commands. <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">The . command is one of the most important Vim commands</a>, so being able to use it in more situations is definitely a win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user\">vim-text-obj-user</a> is an interesting project to make it easy to create plugins that define custom text objects which then can be used with Vim commands like any other text object.  If that sounds scary to you, you can also take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user/wiki\">list</a> of plugins already built with the project, and use any that will be useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/0d938/vimvisuals.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.0145934676859%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Vim side by side styles\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/a9e6e/vimvisuals.png\" srcset=\"/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/40f08/vimvisuals.png 143w,\n/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/d4502/vimvisuals.png 285w,\n/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/a9e6e/vimvisuals.png 570w,\n/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/c2e96/vimvisuals.png 855w,\n/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/f4f98/vimvisuals.png 1140w,\n/static/521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3/0d938/vimvisuals.png 2878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<h4>Help Vim Look Good</h4>\n<p>One of the best uses for plugins is making Vim a bit easier on the eyes. We can do a lot to change Vim’s default look and feel.  For instance the screenshot above shows what MacVim looks like with and without loading my ~/.vimrc file and plugins.  If you’re a writer or developer, you may be looking at Vim for as much as 8-10 hours a day.  So make it something you’re happy to look at.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Syntax highlighting plugins are one of the main things you can use to make your code easier to read.  Vim packages syntax highlighting for many common languages, but for less mainstream languages you’ll need to download plugins to get syntax highlighting.  These plugins often may contain other niceties for the language, like syntax checking or support for compiling from within Vim.  For instance I use plugins for <a href=\"https://github.com/groenewege/vim-less\">Less</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script\">CoffeeScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Colorschemes are also an important part of helping Vim look its best.  Most distributions of Vim bundle several colorschemes, but the most popular ones come as plugins.  If you’re somebody who needs to know that somebody else has sweated the details of the tools you use so that you don’t have to, I recommend <a href=\"http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\">Solarized</a>, a color scheme based on the relationships between different colors and designed to echo the readability of words on paper.  If you like to try different things and have more options, consider looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/chriskempson/base16\">Base16</a>, a project to standardize color scheme creation for multiple editors.  The advantage of both of these schemes is that they’re available for pretty much any editor or tool you’d want to use alongside or in place of Vim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Thematic</a> is a tool to allow you to manage your visual schemes.  So if you like to use different color schemes or fonts in different situations, Thematic can make that easy. You can define a set of “themes”, and then switch between them whenever you feel like it.  As somebody who uses Vim for both writing and programming, it’s nice to be able to use different themes for different situations.  I currently use Solarized for code, and the Pencil theme for writing.  Thematic and Pencil are two of a <a href=\"http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/reed-esau-s-growing-list-of-vim-plugins-for-writers\">wide variety of plugins for writers</a> that Reed Esau has written.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> is a plugin to pretty up your status bar.  It creates the nice triangular effects in the image above, and integrates with other plugins to show helpful information in the status bar.  It does require modified fonts to use though, so you’ll need to have pretty full control of the system you’re on to use this one.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Understand Your Code</h4>\n<p>Vim is not an IDE.  By default it doesn’t understand much about code, and very little about specific languages.  It offloads that knowledge to the operating system, through things like <code class=\"language-text\">:make</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ctags</code>, and to plugins.  Here are a few plugins that can help make Vim a bit more “code aware”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">Syntastic</a> is a syntax checking plugin for Vim that integrates with external syntax checkers to provide in-editor feedback on your code as you make changes.  For instance, it can integrate with jshint, llvm or javac to provide immediate feedback on a file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe\">YouCompleteMe</a> is a code completion engine for Vim that builds on Vim’s built in autocomplete features to offer “smart completion” for as many situations as possible.  It can integrate with Clang, Jedi, Omnisharp, and Vim’s omnicompletion in order to bring smart autocomplete to a variety of languages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive\">Fugitive</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter\">Git-gutter</a> are 2 plugins that bring Git integration into Vim.  Fugitive provides a wrapper around the Git executable to allow you to easily manage your git actions from within Vim. GitGutter focuses on individual files and lets you see where you’ve made uncommited modifications in the current file.  They complement each other well, and are both very useful for heavy Git users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate\">delimitMate</a> is a simple plugin that removes a huge annoyance by auto inserting matching braces and brackets in a smart, intuitive way.  Lack of auto brace insertion was a big mental hurdle for me coming from Sublime Text.  DelimitMate makes things work the way I expect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language specific plugins are another plugin group worth investigating.  There are way too many examples to list here, but one that I use and enjoy is <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">TernJs</a>, a code intelligence plugin for Javascript that you can use with something like YouCompleteMe to get the type of IDE style autocompletion that is very rare for Javascript code.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Play Nice With Others</h4>\n<p>Some plugins exist to provide tighter integration between Vim and external programs.  We’ve already touched on a few of those, like Ack.vim and Syntastic.  Vim is intended to follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well and working well with other programs.  Integration plugins allow for deeper versions of that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator\">Tmux Navigator</a> is a must have plugin for <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">Tmux</a> users.  It allows you to easily move between tmux and Vim splits using a single set of keyboard mappings.  It lets Vim and tmux work together in a completely natural way, without the user having to keep track of where one ends and the other begins.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash.vim</a> is an OSX only plugin that provides integration with Dash.app, a documentation manager app for OSX, making it easy to look up library method definitions from within Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Grant Vim Superpowers</h4>\n<p>The last category of plugins are scripts that allow Vim to do things that are totally different than anything it can do on its own.  These may be features pulled from other editors, or features inspired by Vim but implemented differently than the Vim core.  These can be pretty amazing, but I’d be careful with them to start.  You’ll want to learn how Vim works before piling a bunch of big extensions on top of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Ultisnips</a> allows Vim to use Textmate like “snippets” that allow you to save canned templates of code or text, then insert and modify them whenever you’re ready.  If this sounds interesting, I’d recommend checking out the recent <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-ultisnips/\">Vimcast</a> episodes where Drew explores Ultisnips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion\">EasyMotion</a> is a plugin that introduces a new type of movement to Vim.  It creates alternative versions of the Vim movements like <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">w</code> that allow you to find a character or word anywhere on the screen, and specify it by using a key character that temporarily appears on the screen in place of each possible target character.

I’ve covered a lot of ground in my posts on Vim this past month, but it’s only scratched the surface of what Vim has to offer.  The goal was to create a foundation that people could start with, and then let them build on their own. There’s not a conclusive way to say what somebody “needs to know” when learning Vim.  Most people don’t (and shouldn’t) use every feature of the editor, they use the ones that make sense for them.  So I’ve tried to cover the things that I know people have found useful, and the philosophy behind how Vim works, and then let you figure out what you’d like to use on your own.  This post wraps up the series, but I wanted to highlight one last feature of Vim, its fantastic search capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Vim has an extremely powerful built in search tool.  To use it, you can type <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> at anytime in normal mode to start entering search terms.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code> followed by enter searches for the next occurrence of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document.  You can then skip over matches with <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> or go backwards with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code>.  If you wanted to start by searching backwards, you could have started with <code class=\"language-text\">?foo</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code>, in which case <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> would reverse behavior, with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> moving forward in the document and <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> moving back.  It’s easiest to think of <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> as “next match” and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> as “previous match”, with the direction determined by the search operator, <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">?</code>.</p>\n<p>The search tool can be used for more than simple literal expressions, it also takes regular expressions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">/fo.\\|bar</code> will match <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">fox</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  You also can search for lines containing both foo and bar with the expression <code class=\"language-text\">/.*foo\\&amp;.*bar</code>.  If you want to dig deeper into Vim’s regex language, I’d recommend typing in <code class=\"language-text\">:h pattern</code> to check out the excellent documentation.</p>\n<h3>Substitute</h3>\n<p>Search is great, but in many cases what we want to use it for is replacing or acting on each instance.  Vim’s search and replace command looks something like <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/foo/bar/g</code>, which will replace all occurences of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  Let’s break that down a bit.  <code class=\"language-text\">:s</code> (substitute) is Vim’s search and replace command.  By default it only works on the current line, so in order to get it to act on the whole document I prepended the <code class=\"language-text\">%</code> character, which sets the range to include everything.  If you want a smaller range, you can select the text you want to act on in visual mode. Typing <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> will then preload the range into the command area.  Substitute takes an expression in the form <code class=\"language-text\">/&lt;search expression&gt;/&lt;replace string&gt;/&lt;modifiers&gt;</code>  where search expression defines the search, replace string is the text to substitute in, and modifiers are single letter arguments that change the behavior.  By default only the first instance of an expression per line is substituted, so I added the <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> modifier to tell Vim to substitute all instances of the search expression on a line.  Other useful modifiers are <code class=\"language-text\">i</code>, which makes the search case insensitive, and <code class=\"language-text\">c</code> which has Vim prompt for confirmation before substituting each instance. Confirmation is helpful if you want to change most but not all occurences of a phrase. One useful behavior of substitute to be aware of: If you leave the search expression blank, it reuses your last search.  So if you’ve been playing around with a regex to get the right expression, once you get it right you can type <code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;replacement&gt;/g</code>, and it will replace all instances, without forcing you to retype your complicated regex.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that search plays nicely with Vim’s <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">composable actions</a>, and you can use it as a motion command with <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">c</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> or other actions.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">d/foo</code> will delete all text up to the next occurence of foo in the document. <code class=\"language-text\">y?foo</code> will yank all text backwards to the previous occurence of foo in the document.</p>\n<h3>Inline Searching</h3>\n<p>Along with the primary search and substitute commands, Vim has other specialty searching tools.  One of these is its <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> commands. <code class=\"language-text\">f&lt;char&gt;</code> moves to a single character on the current line.  While less powerful than <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, this can be super useful because of its quick composability and guarantee of not moving out of the current scope.  It’s really easy to type <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> to delete through the end of the parentheses.  <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> works similarly, but is non-inclusive, so you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ct)</code> to delete everything up to and not including the parentheses.  I remember it as “change find character” and “change to character” respectively.  Like <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, these commands support backwards and repeated search.  <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">T</code> search backwards on the current line, and <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> are the default commands for “next match” and “previous match” respectively.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file searching with vimgrep and grep</h3>\n<p>Searching within a file is nice, but what if you want to search in multiple files?  Vim provides 2 commands for that.  The first, <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep</code>, uses Vim’s internal regex engines to search across multiple files. You could for instance type <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep /function/i ./*.js</code> to search all Javascript files in the current directory for the “function” keyword.  You’d then be able to loop through them using the <code class=\"language-text\">:ln</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:lp</code> commands.</p>\n<p>The second command, <code class=\"language-text\">:grep</code>, integrates with an external search application (grep by default), to do the searching.  The advantage of the first is that it’s portable and will be available anywhere and everywhere that Vim is.  But generally external tools are going to be faster than Vim’s internal search engine.  Grep for instance is faster than vimgrep.  I personally use the external tool <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> which is faster than grep.  Regardless though, Vim has support for whatever approach you choose to take.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file replace with the arglist</h3>\n<p>Up till now we’ve mostly been dealing with tasks that Vim has good answers for.  If you want to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim though, you end up in some of the more esoteric parts of Vim-land.  In order to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim, you need to first define a set of files to edit, and then run the replace command.  Unfortunately there is no way in Vim to cleanly do this all in a single command.  Instead you must pull your list of files from one of 3 places, the arglist, the buffer list, or the window list.  The arglist is by default the files that you specified to open when you initially opened Vim, the buffer list is your list of currently opened buffers, and the window list is the list of files in currently open windows.  Since you probably don’t want to have to open or view all the files that you want to run a search/replace on, and you may want to have files open or visible without running a replace on them, the arglist is the list of choice for replacements.  Vim allows you to edit the contents of the arglist at any time using the <code class=\"language-text\">:argadd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">argdelete</code> commands.  So to replace <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code> for all javascript files in the current directory you might type something like.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">:argd * &quot;Clear arglist\n:arga ./*.js  &quot;Add javascript files\n:argdo %s/foo/bar/g &quot;Substitute on each file</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">argdo</code> is the command to execute a command across all files in the arglist.  <code class=\"language-text\">bufdo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">tabdo</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">windo</code> work the same way for every “open buffer”, “active window in each tab”, and “window in the current tab” respectively. Personally I find this all to be a pain.  A single command that let you specify an action and a range to run it on like <code class=\"language-text\">:do &#39;%s/foo/bar/g&#39; ./*.js</code> would make plenty of sense.  But since that doesn’t exist, it’s worth at least knowing that the arglist is there, and being able to resort to it if necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Power Of Search</h3>\n<p>Most people start out using Vim knowing that they can move around with <em>hjkl</em> and switch between files with <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code> as they learn more they grow their toolbox. Search is a great tool for moving quickly around text in Vim, and for powerfully making big edits.  Searching allows you to allow your brain to focus on the big picture, rather than remembering exactly where each piece of code or content is located. Like everything else in Vim, it’s a tool that you can combine with other tools to create powerful workflows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/\">Vimcasts</a> has a nice piece on the <code class=\"language-text\">gn</code> command, an alternative to <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> that lets you select the next search match in visual mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace\">Vim’s wiki</a> also has a nice writeup of the <code class=\"language-text\">:substitute</code> command, with lots of examples and details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["vim","productivity"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: The Basics","description":"The basics of learning Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics","date":"2014-06-30T11:28:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Do you want to be efficient writing code?  Using Vim can be a powerful help.  Using it has let me move more effectively through the process of writing and editing code.  But getting to where I am now was frustrating. Vim resources are scattered across the web, and contain a lot of different advice.  It’s tough to figure out how to make Vim work for you.  In my next few posts, I’m going to talk about the process of learning a 23 year old programming power tool, and what you need to know in 2014 to be productive with Vim.  Today I’ll start with the basics, stuff that goes back all the way to the 1970s, and we’ll grow from there.</p>\n<h3>Why has Vim Survived?</h3>\n<p>Vim has been around for a while.  Originally released in 1991 as an improvement on vi (which had been around since 1976), it has outlasted a generation of programmers. The software world has changed a lot since 1991.  So why do people still use it?  </p>\n<p>Vim provides a system for editing text that is quite simply more powerful than its modern graphical based alternatives.  It asks a lot of its users. To use Vim effectively you have to internalize the syntax for many commands that have better affordances on other editors.  But you’re rewarded with a friction-free editing environment.  Vi’s commands are fast, composable, and powerful. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h3>Step 0: Setup</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is install a copy of Vim. If you’re on a Linux or Mac system, there is likely already a system copy, but it is probably not up to date.  So use your system’s package manager to get the latest version (7.4 at the time of this writing).  For Mac users I recommend using <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> to download <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a>. Windows users can download the latest executable on <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/download.php\">Vim.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The second thing you’ll need is a vimrc (the file vim uses for configuration).  These files can become quite extensive, setting up many different options, configurations, and plugins.  But we’re going to start simple.  Download <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">this minimal vimrc file</a> and install it in the appropriate directory for your OS as instructed.  If you already have a .vimrc file but don’t understand it, I’d recommend saving it elsewhere and using a minimal one for now. You can then build it out as you learn more.  </p>\n<h3>Step 1: Learn the Syntax</h3>\n<p>Just like a programming language, the first thing to learn for Vim is the basic syntax.  Vim has a built in tool to help you get comfortable called vimtutor.  It’s a text file set up to help you learn to navigate Vim. Once vim is installed you can run it by calling vimtutor on unix-style systems.  On Windows you can follow the instructions <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/270938/how-to-run-vimtutor-on-windows\">here</a>. It will take you through a series of 7 lessons that will familiarize you with the basic commands.</p>\n<p>Vim has rather non-standard commands, and it may be frustrating at first adapting to its different terminology and conventions.  The payoff comes slowly, but it does come.</p>\n<h4>Modes</h4>\n<p>The most important thing to understand is that Vim is a modal editor.  At any given time you’re in one of 6 modes.  You will have different abilities and keystrokes available to you in each of these modes.  For right now the key modes to understand are Normal Mode, Insert Mode, and Command line Mode.</p>\n<p>Normal Mode is the default mode.  It’s roughly equivalent to the state that other editors are in when you’re holding down the ctrl or cmd keys.  Instead of entering text onto the screen, different keys trigger different commands.  Initially this is a bit weird.  Those of us coming from other editors or IDEs are used to being able to type text by default.  The thought is that adding text is the primary task in a text editor.  But Vim treats adding text as sitting on equal footing with editing, deleting and manipulating existing text, and starts us in a mode where we can quickly make any change. To steal an analogy from Drew Neil, normal mode is the opportunity to take our paintbrush off the canvas while we decide our next stroke.  </p>\n<p>Insert mode is the equivalent of most editor’s normal state.  When you type a key in normal mode, it appears on the screen. You can enter insert mode by pressing <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> in visual mode, and exit it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Command line mode lets you enter ex-commands, a command line language that complements normal modes shortcuts.  You enter it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> in normal mode.  Important commands are <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code> to write (save) a file, and <code class=\"language-text\">:q!</code> to quit.</p>\n<p>The above commands, and an understanding of the modes are enough for you to survive in Vim, and treat it as a sort of awkward Notepad clone.  You can edit files, save them, and quit.  Going through vimtutor will introduce you to many more commands, and a few more modes.  But you can learn those at your own pace.  Right now you want to see what taking time to learn this awkward unfamiliar syntax can buy you.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Learn the Language</h3>\n<p>Vim’s key commands are different than you’ll find in other editors like Sublime Text.  They’re not a series of standalone actions that you can do one after another to get what you want.  Instead they form a language.  </p>\n<p>Vim statements are made up of actions and motions.  The actions are what you’re trying to do, the motions are where you want to do them.</p>\n<p>For example let’s take the <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> action. <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> deletes. You can delete a single character by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dl</code>.  You can delete 2 characters by typing <code class=\"language-text\">d2l</code>. You can delete a whole line by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, or delete inside a word by typing <code class=\"language-text\">diw</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you learn the d action, you can use it with every motion you know. Similarly, when you learn a new motion, you can then use it with every action you know.</p>\n<p>So if somebody shows me the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> action and tells me that it yanks (copies) text, I’ll know I can yank a character with <code class=\"language-text\">yl</code> a line with <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> and inside the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">yiw</code>.  Each new Vim command is a tool in your toolbox, and since the tools build off of each other they become exponentially more valuable.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Learn the Mindset</h3>\n<p>Vim can make you hyper-efficient.  But to get there you need to know more than just the command combinations available.  You have to shift your mindset.  Vim commands aren’t just easy to learn, they’re designed to be repeatable.  Bram Moolenar, Vim’s creator has listed out <a href=\"http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html\">7 habits of effective text editing</a>.  The second habit, don’t type it twice, is a pretty good summary of the “Vim Way” of doing things.</p>\n<p>Vim provides a bunch of ways to avoid repetition.  I’ll get into them in another post. For now though, let’s take a look at <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>, the dot command.  The dot command repeats the last action you’ve taken. For instance, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to change a word, hit <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code> to return to normal mode, then move to another word and type <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace that word as well.  You are able to avoid retyping the replacement word as well as the <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> command. You can run the whole replace with one keystroke, regardless of what words you’re replacing.  Like other Vim commands, the dot command is small on its own, but gains power as you add more tools to your toolbox.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<p>If you enjoyed this article you’ll probably also enjoy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356980&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS\">Practical Vim</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356980\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">: This amazing book by Drew Neil, the creator of <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/\">Vimcasts</a> was the single best resource I found as I learned Vim.

If you’re reading this blog, I bet you like it.  What if I told you your text editor could help you cut the amount of time you spend typing in half, with just a little reading and a bit of practice?  For you Vim users, it’s very possible that you’re spending way more time typing than needed.</p>\n<p>The software developers reading this have probably heard of the <em>Don’t Repeat Yourself</em> principle.  Developers want to avoid duplicating work, and try to write each distinct meaningful chunk of code only once.

For pretty much any thing you do in Vim, there are ways to automate and repeat it.  These “repeating commands” are powerful tools, but it’s not always easy to know what to do with them.  There aren’t simple rules you can learn for when to use repeating commands.

We’ll ignore “language-wise” refactoring solutions, like <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">ternjs</a>, and look at the basic Vim options.  </p>\n<p>A simple find and replace causes problems.  We can’t distinguish between the widget we want and other occurences.  <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/widget/testWidget/g</code> results in plenty of unwanted changes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidget <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Widget</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidgets <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">WidgetCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ntestWidgets<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'testWidget passed test'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>It might be possible to find a complex regex that only hit the variables we want, but thats suddenly a lot of thought for what should be a simple change.  We could go one by one and knock out each word one by one.  But that would be a lot of repeated typing of <code class=\"language-text\">testWidget</code>.  So what can we do?</p>\n<p>The dot command is a nice solution.  If we start on the first occurence of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to replace the current word with new text.  When we’ve added our new text and exit insert mode, we’ll have a <em>command</em>, which we can then repeat with <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>. After that we can move to the next occurence we want to change and hit <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace it without retyping the variable name.  If we accidentally use it in the wrong place, it’s easy to undo with <code class=\"language-text\">u</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course it would still be a pain to navigate between each widget with hjkl.  Fortunately, Vim has more commands that allow us to avoid unecessary work.  If we start on one instance of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> to search for all occurences of that word.  We can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> to move from occurence to occurence. If we overshoot and go too far, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> to go backwards.  So if we start with <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> (shift+8 in the gif below) and then use ciw to replace the word, we can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to clean up the other widgets in only 5 keystrokes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/vimdotcommand-fcd9036267e137c552c8afdc822b223f.gif\" alt=\"vim gif\"></p>\n<h4>The Vim Way</h4>\n<p>If you’re used to another editor, I’m guessing you’re justifiably a bit skeptical at this point.  After all, this example is something people do all the time, and many editors have tools to make it easy (multiple selections in Sublime Text and refactoring tools in language specific IDEs like Eclipse for instance).  They may take even fewer keystrokes than Vim. And they don’t require you to learn 6 separate commands to use well.  So what’s so special here?</p>\n<p>Let’s have a quick refresher on the philosophy of Vim.  Like the Unix ecosystem it came from, Vim provides <strong>small</strong>, <strong>composable</strong> tools that you can combine to create powerful actions.  The power isn’t in a specific use case.  Instead it comes from the range of possibilities that open up when we start mixing and matching the code.  As with verbs, movements, and text objects, repeating commands and their corresponding reverse commands are tools we can add to our toolbox.  Using the commands above and some of the other composable commands from my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language post</a>, we can do some cool things.</p>\n<p>We can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search through json files and selectively remove lines that contain an attribute we don’t want to use (start on the attribute, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly to select lines to delete)</li>\n<li>Replace a long, hard to type function name throughout the document with another version without having to type out the function name (start on the function name, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;newname&gt;/g</code>)</li>\n<li>Fix poorly indented lines using the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command (<code class=\"language-text\">&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;&lt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly, <code class=\"language-text\">u</code> to undo if you go too far. This can easily be used on groups of lines using visual mode too)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do all of these have in common?  They all use a command once, and a movement at most once, then allow for as much repetition as you like.

In many scenarios, once you’ve made a change and movement once, you can then get by with a single keystroke for each future action and movement, with another keystroke available to cancel an action if you go too far.  Here’s a partial list of repeating commands, with the corresponding cancel command to undo them.</p>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Repeating Command</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Canceling Command</th></tr>\n<tr><td>.</td><td>Repeat the last normal mode command</td><td>u</td></tr>\n<tr><td>n</td><td>Repeat the last Search</td><td>N</td></tr>\n<tr><td>;</td><td>Repeat the last character-wise search</td><td>,</td></tr>\n<tr><td>/<replacement>/</td><td>Repeat the last search</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@:</td><td>Repeat the last ex-mode command</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@@</td><td>Repeat the last Macro used</td><td>u</td></tr>\n</table>\n<p>None of these commands are all that useful on their own, but they’re each valuable things to learn as you build up your Vim toolbox. Focus on one or two to start, and learn to make edits so that you can easily repeat them. The art of Vim is learning to look for those opportunities, and crafting your commands so that they’re short, powerful, and repeatable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of you are probably confused that I wrote a whole post on repeating commands in Vim with only one side-reference to Macros.

Vim doesn’t speak English, but it has a language of its own, built out of composable commands, that is much more efficient than the simple movement and editing commands you’ll find in other editors.  In my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">last post</a>, I took an initial look at Vim as a language.  I’m going to dive deeper into that here.</p>\n<h3>Vim Verbs: What can you do?</h3>\n<p>Vim’s “verbs” mostly fall into 2 main categories.  Some of them act on a single character, and others act on a “motion” or “text object”.  We’ll look at motions in a second, but lets start by looking at the verbs.</p>\n<h4>Single character verbs</h4>\n<p>So like I said, there are a few vim actions that act on a single character.  They act as shortcuts for actions that you can also perform with motions, and allow you to save a few keystrokes.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>Delete character under the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>r</td><td>Replace character under cursor with another character</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>s</td><td>Delete character under cursor and move to insert mode</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These are great commands to know, and things that I use daily, but they act as a bit of an island.  Let’s look at some verbs with more power.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>d<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>c<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion and go into insert mode</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>y<motion></td><td>Yank (copy) text specified by motion</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These aren’t the only 3 actions that you can use with motions, but they’re probably the most important. The first 2 are roughly the same as deleting or cutting in most instances, with the option to choose what mode you end in. The 3rd is Vim’s version of copying.</p>\n<h4>Motions</h4>\n<p>So how do we use these actions?  You’ll notice that if you type any of the above characters into Vim by themselves, nothing happens.  That’s because they’re expecting something to act on.  If you’re a grammar nerd or remember your 8th grade english classes, you can think of these as transitive verbs that need to act on a direct object.  These “direct objects” come in 2 forms, motions and text objects.  Motions are the motion commands that you can use at any time to move around Vim.  Some examples:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Motion</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the line</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>G<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the file</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>f.<motion></td><td>Go to the next occurrence of `.` on the current line</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>All of these commands work as motions on their own, but when you combine them with actions you can get powerful effects.  So <code class=\"language-text\">d$</code> means “delete to the end of the line”.  <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> means “change through the next closing parentheses” and <code class=\"language-text\">yG</code> means copy everything through the end of the file.  The list above is only a small subset of the motions available.  I’d suggest learning 1 or 2 to start and using them when appropriate.  As you get more comfortable with Vim you can continue to add more, and each one will unlock a set of commands for all of the actions you know.</p>\n<p>The second type of “direct object” that Vim verbs can take is a text object.  You can think of text objects as a “defined chunk of text.”  Some examples include selecting words, html tag contents, or the contents of a function.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Text Object</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iw</td><td>Applies to everything in the current word</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>it<motion></td><td>Applies to everything in current xml/html tag</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>i{<motion></td><td>Applies to everything inside nearest curly brackets</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>So using text objects you can change the contents of a word with the easily memorizable <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> (change in word), or copy the contents of an html <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with yit.  It’s worth mentioning here that one of the most powerful text objects is a bit of an oddball.  A really common thing people do is applying an action to the current line.  Vi’s language makes this easy by allowing the shortcut for this text object to be a simple repeat of the action.  So <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> yanks the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> deletes it, and <code class=\"language-text\">cc</code> changes it.</p>\n<h4>Piece by Piece</h4>\n<p>The key here is that learning Vim isn’t something you do in a weekend. It’s an iterative process. Since the actions, motions, and text objects build on themselves, you can start to grow your toolbox exponentially as time goes on.  But you’ll want to start with a few commands that you find make you productive.  I’ve personally found <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ci(</code> to be incredibly useful commands, and a great place to start as you learn to use these commands instead of the slower “mouse and select” methods that you may be used to. When we learn languages we all start with basic sentences, learn the grammar rules and grow from there.  Vim is no different. Start small and add to your toolbox as you build great things with it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/1424361\">Your problem with Vim is that you don’t grok vi</a> - A concise explanation of what makes vi/vim special, and one of the most popular answers ever on Stack Overflow.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1\">Why Atom can’t replace Vim</a> - A great piece on the big picture importance of composable commands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/\">Vim Text Objects: The Definitive Guide</a> - This is a nice rundown of the different text objects available, including some that you can add using plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Update</h4>\n<p>This post is currently on the front page of Hacker News.

One of the messiest parts of my transition to using Vim full time was its way of dealing with files.  Coming to Vim after primarily using Eclipse and Sublime Text, it frustrated me that Vim doesn’t bundle a persistent file system viewer, and the built-in ways of opening and switching files always felt extremely painful.  </p>\n<p>At this point I appreciate the depth of Vim’s file management features. I’ve put together a system that works for me even better than more visual editors once did. Because it’s purely keyboard based, it allows me to move through my code much faster.  That took some time though, and involves several plugins. But the first step was me understanding Vim’s built in options for dealing with files. This post will be looking at the most important structures Vim provides you for file management, with a quick peek at some of the more advanced features you can get through plugins.</p>\n<h3>The Basics: Opening a new file</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles to learning Vim is its lack of visual affordances.  Unlike modern GUI based editors, there is no obvious way to do anything when you open a new instance of Vim in the terminal.  Everything is done through keyboard commands, and while that ends up being more efficient for experienced users, new Vim users will find themselves looking up even basic commands routinely.  So lets start with the basics.</p>\n<p>The command to open a new file in Vim is <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code>.  <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> opens up a new buffer with the contents of the file inside. If the file doesn’t exist yet it opens up an empty buffer and will write to the file location you specify once you make changes and save. Buffers are Vim’s term for a “block of text stored in memory”. That text can be associated with an existing file or not, but there will be one buffer for each file you have open.</p>\n<p>After you open a file and make changes, you can save the contents of the buffer back to the file with the write command <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code>.  If the buffer is not yet associated with a file or you want to save to a different location, you can save to a specific file with <code class=\"language-text\">:w &lt;filename&gt;</code>. You may need to add a <code class=\"language-text\">!</code> and use <code class=\"language-text\">:w! &lt;filename&gt;</code> if you’re overwriting an existing file.</p>\n<p>This is the survival level knowledge for dealing with Vim files.  Plenty of developers get by with just these commands, and its technically all you need.  But Vim offers a lot more for those who dig a bit deeper.</p>\n<h3>Buffer Management</h3>\n<p>Moving beyond the basics, let’s talk some more about buffers.  Vim handles open files a bit differently than other editors.  Rather than leaving all open files visible as tabs, or only allowing you to have one file open at a time, Vim allows you to have multiple buffers open.  Some of these may be visible while others are not.  You can view a list of all open buffers at any time with <code class=\"language-text\">:ls</code>.  This shows each open buffer, along with their buffer number.  You can then switch to a specific buffer with the <code class=\"language-text\">:b &lt;buffer-number&gt;</code> command, or move in order along the list with the <code class=\"language-text\">:bnext</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bprevious</code> commands. (these can be shortened to <code class=\"language-text\">:bn</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bp</code> respectively).  </p>\n<p>While these commands are the fundamental Vim solutions for managing buffers, I’ve found that they don’t map well to my own way of thinking about files.  I don’t want to care about the order of buffers, I just want to go to the file I’m thinking about, or maybe to the file I was just in before the current one.  So while its important to understand Vim’s underlying buffer model, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend its builtin commands as your main file management strategy.  There are more powerful options available.</p>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/bff7b/skitch.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.15424164524421%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"splits example\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/c8bb8/skitch.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/5f247/skitch.jpg 143w,\n/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/531b1/skitch.jpg 285w,\n/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/c8bb8/skitch.jpg 570w,\n/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/3b53c/skitch.jpg 855w,\n/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/a7625/skitch.jpg 1140w,\n/static/e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e/bff7b/skitch.jpg 1167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<h3>Splits</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of managing files in Vim is its splits.  With Vim, you can split your current window into 2 windows at any time, and then resize and arrange them into any configuration you like.  Its not unusual for me to have 6 files open at a given time, each with its own small split of the window.</p>\n<p>You can open a new split with <code class=\"language-text\">:sp &lt;filename&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">:vs &lt;filename&gt;</code>, for horizontal and vertical splits respectively.  There are keyword commands you can use to then resize the windows the way you want them, but to be honest this is the one Vim task I prefer to do with my mouse.  A mouse gives me more precision without having to guess the number of columns I want or fiddle back and forth between 2 widths.  </p>\n<p>After you create some splits, you can switch back and forth between them with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-w [h|j|k|l]</code>.  This is a bit clunky though, and it’s important for common operations to be efficient and easy. If you use splits heavily, I would personally recommend aliasing these commands to <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-h</code> <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j</code> etc in your .vimrc using this snippet.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\"><pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">nnoremap &lt;C-J&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-J&gt; &quot;Ctrl-j to move down a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-K&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-K&gt; &quot;Ctrl-k to move up a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-L&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-L&gt; &quot;Ctrl-l to move\tright a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-H&gt; &quot;Ctrl-h to move left a split</code></pre></div>\n<h3>The jumplist</h3>\n<p>Splits solve the problem of viewing multiple related files at a time, but we still haven’t seen a satisfactory solution for moving quickly between open and hidden files.  The jumplist is one tool you can use for that.  </p>\n<p>The jumplist is one of those Vim features that can appear weird or even useless at first.  Vim keeps track of every motion command and file switch you make as you’re editing files.  Every time you “jump” from one place to another in a split, Vim adds an entry to the jumplist. While this may initially seem like a small thing, it becomes powerful when you’re switching files a lot, or moving around in a large file.  Instead of having to remember your place, or worry about what file you were in, you can instead retrace your footsteps quickly using some quick key commands.  <code class=\"language-text\">Ctrl-o</code> allows you to jump back to your last jump location.  Repeating it multiple times allows you to quickly jump back to the last file or code chunk you were working on, without having to keep the details of where that code is in your head. You can then move back up the chain with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-i</code>. This turns out to be immensely powerful when you’re moving around in code quickly, debugging a problem in multiple files or flipping back and forth between 2 files. Instead of typing file names or remembering buffer numbers, you can just move up and down the existing path.  It’s not the answer to everything, but like other Vim concepts, it’s a small focused tool that adds to the overall power of the editor without trying to do everything.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>So let’s be real, if you’re coming to Vim from something like Sublime Text or Atom, there’s a good chance all of this looks a bit arcane, scary, and inefficient.  “Why would I want to type the full path to open a file when Sublime has fuzzy finding?”  “How can I get a view of a project’s structure without a sidebar to show the directory tree?”  Legitimate questions.  The good news is that Vim has solutions.  They’re just not baked into the Vim core.  I’ll touch more on Vim configuration and plugins in later posts, but for now here’s a pointer to 3 helpful plugins that you can use to get Sublime-like file management.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is a fuzzy finding file search similar to Sublime’s “Go to Anything” bar.  It’s lightning fast and pretty configurable.  I use it as my main way of opening new files.  With it I only need to know part of the file name and don’t need to memorize my project’s directory structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is a “file navigation drawer” plugin that replicates the side file navigation that many editors have.  I actually rarely use it, as fuzzy search always seems faster to me.  But it can be useful coming into a project, when you’re trying to learn the project structure and see what’s available.  NERDTree is immensely configurable, and also replaces Vim’s built in directory tools when installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> is a code search plugin for Vim that allows you to search across your project for text expressions.  It acts as a light wrapper around Ack or Ag, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">2 great code search tools</a>, and allows you to quickly jump to any occurrence of a search term in your project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between it’s core and its plugin ecosystem, Vim offers enough tools to allow you to craft your workflow anyway you want.  File management is a key part of a good software development system, and it’s worth experimenting to get it right.</p>\n<p>Start with the basics for long enough to understand them, and then start adding tools on top until you find a comfortable workflow. It will all be worth it when you’re able to seamlessly move to the code you want to work on without the mental overhead of figuring out how to get there.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/seamlessly-navigate-vim-and-tmux-splits\">Seamlessly Navigate Vim &#x26; Tmux Splits</a> - This is a must read for anyone who wants to use vim with <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">tmux</a>.

Over the last 10 years, the JavaScript ecosystem has built up a rich set of tools to make your life easier.  Most of the buzz around tooling comes from browser devtools and the various build systems available for JavaScript projects, but you can also take advantage of improved tools within your code editor.  While there are some great IDEs for JavaScript development out there like WebStorm and Visual Studio, most JavaScript developers seem to prefer lighter-weight text editors.  So this post is going to be a quick look at the tools I use for more seamless JavaScript development in a text editor.</p>\n<h3>Basics</h3>\n<p>Before we get to anything JavaScript specific, there are a few important things to set up.  First, I’m assuming that you’re using a modern, extensible text editor. Those include, but are not limited to: <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\">Emacs</a>. There is great support for all of the below tips in each of these editors<sup id=\"fnref:0\"><a href=\"#fn:0\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition you should have</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reasonable default configurations<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>A fast system for navigating between files<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Great code searching<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">4</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re still working through those things, make sure to take the time to learn a bit more about your editor along with any JavaScript specific tools you use.  There’s a ton of efficiency you can gain from having those 3 things in place.</p>\n<p>Finally the first two tips below require <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">node.JS</a> and npm to be installed, as they rely on node libraries to function.  If you’ve never installed those before, the process is pretty painless.</p>\n<p>Once you have all of that in place, we can move on to other things.</p>\n<h3>Syntax Linting</h3>\n<p>JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly-typed language.  It is also written by human beings.  As a result, it can be easy to start running bad code without realizing that it has problems.  Some types of problems you’ll find out about quickly.  Bad syntax will halt program execution for instance.  But others will linger, subtly effecting logic or just making the code hard to understand for future developers (including yourself).   </p>\n<p>JavaScript linters (also called syntax checkers) can provide some of the safety of a compiler, and also help enforce a consistent set of styles to help maintain readability.  They are not magic.  JavaScript is still a weakly typed language with some weird syntactical sinkholes. It’s relatively easy to make logic mistakes if you’re undisciplined.  But linters are a great safety tool, especially for developers newer to JavaScript and its conventions.  Run as part of a build process, they can prevent you shipping bad code and help standardize conventions across a team</p>\n<p>While it’s a great idea to make linters part of your build process, you get even more power from integrating them with your editor.  Almost all modern text editors include some sort of plugin for displaying syntax errors and warnings in the gutter to the left of the text.  You can check out the integration pages for <a href=\"http://eslint.org/docs/integrations/\">ESLint</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/install/\">jsHint</a> to get a feel for the plugins available for your editor.  </p>\n<p><span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 82.47422680412372%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"linting picture\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/a9e6e/lintingpic.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/40f08/lintingpic.png 143w,\n/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/d4502/lintingpic.png 285w,\n/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/a9e6e/lintingpic.png 570w,\n/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/c2e96/lintingpic.png 855w,\n/static/408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae/9435c/lintingpic.png 970w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n  </span></p>\n<h3>TernJS + Autocomplete</h3>\n<p>Linters are great for telling you what not to do, but can’t give you much guidance on what you actually are able to do.  Fortunately we have other tools for that.  <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern.js</a> is a fantastic library that provides “intellisense” style autocompleting for JavaScript code, along with other IDE-like features including documentation links and refactoring support. It’s not perfect, since JavaScript’s nondeterministic syntax sometimes makes it hard to tell what properties a variable will actually have at runtime, but it takes a good shot at it and is able to go pretty far, especially for libraries where it can expose the full API to you within the editor.  To get the most out of Tern, you’ll need to set up a Tern project definition, where you can specify any files that you always want loaded, and any plugins you want to use. The preloaded files is useful if you’re making global references to a namespace or library, and the plugins can give you support for module systems, so that you can handle references that are passed into a module from a different file in code using requireJS or Angular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ternjs-46e25e5899958f3bd960e5692375a92b.gif\" alt=\"ternjs picture\"></p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>JavaScript development, especially on the front end, can involve a lot of repetitive boilerplate code<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">5</a></sup>.  Whether it’s module boilerplate like AMD require/define wrappers, library boilerplate like directive definitions in Angular or a Model definition in Backbone, or our own favorite patterns that we repeat a lot, we end up writing a lot of code over and over again.  Snippets are a great way to accomplish that.  They were one of the key features of Textmate when it first became popular.  Today they’re built in to Sublime Text and Atom, and there are popular libraries for both <a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet\">Emacs</a> to simulate the same functionality.</p>\n<p>Snippets allow you to define templates for common boilerplate code, allowing you to quickly insert repetitive content, including adding hooks for text that will vary across uses.  For instance here’s a snippet I have defined for creating a new AMD module<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#A new AMD define module\nsnippet dfn\ndefine([$1],function($2) {\n    $0  \n});\nendsnippet</code></pre></div>\n<p>This allows me to type <em>dfn&#x3C;tab></em> at any time to expand out the template.  Initially my cursor will be in spot <code class=\"language-text\">$1</code>, and I can then enter text and tab to spot <code class=\"language-text\">$2</code>, with my final tab ending me at <code class=\"language-text\">$0</code>.  Snippet libraries can also provide other functionality like functions to show the current time, filename, or other contextual information.   Some can also mirror text so that you can enter a string once and have it appear throughout the template.  It can be a great time saver when you’re chugging through the boilerplate code of your project.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to implement JavaScript syntax checking definitely check out <a href=\"http://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/\">jsHint</a>.  They both offer a lot more options and flexibility than <a href=\"http://www.jslint.com/\">jsLint</a>, the pioneer in this area.  It’s pretty easy to find an integration plugin for most common editors through those websites or Google, but <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntasticsu\">Syntastic</a> for Vim and <a href=\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3j\">Sublime Linter</a> for Sublime Text come especially recommended and have the advantage of supporting all 3 major JavaScript linters as well as syntax checking for multiple languages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern’s website</a> has great documentation and links to the editor specific implementations for different editors.

They’re the ones who can take a crazy, vague bug report from a client and come up with a fix in an hour.  The ones who everybody else asks for help when the project deadline is creeping up.  The ones who get shipped out to the client site when the field team is out of their depth.  In school they were the person you called at 1AM the night before your project was due, hoping for a miracle.</p>\n<p>I’m guessing you can think of somebody.  Problem solving is a valuable gift, something that stands out.  But the truth is, all software developers should be problem solvers.  It’s a key part of our jobs.  We just happen to call it debugging.</p>\n<p>Debugging is hard.  As developers, we’re faced with vague problem descriptions, massive code bases, and constant pressure to move our projects forward.  But you can do some great things if you’re disciplined about getting better at debugging.</p>\n<p>I’ve built up my own debugging process over the years.  It’s nothing more exciting than <em>Problem Solving 101</em>, but it’s a productive way of working that lets me get stuff fixed quickly and keep issues from happening again. It helps me fix things even when I’m not qualified to do so, and keeps maintenance work from overwhelming my ability to get things done.  If that sounds useful to you, you should probably keep reading. Here’s my process.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Define The Problem</h3>\n<p>The need to define the problem seems like common sense, but it often gets skipped.  The first thing you need before fixing a problem is a clear definition of what the problem looks like.  That means a detailed look at 2 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the current behavior?</li>\n<li>What should the behavior be?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second question often gets neglected.  At Windsor Circle, we have a system that receives product records from another system.  The data it was receiving occasionally contained blank product titles, which was not considered valid data.  I was asked to ensure that the second system would not pass invalid data.  I could of course have just decided to not pass any records that had blank product data.  Or I could have filled them with a <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;None&quot;</code> string, calculated a value from other attributes, or a thousand other approaches.  Since each of these would have removed the current bad behavior, I might have been able to slip them by for a while.  Instead I asked what the correct behavior should be, which led to a longer discussion and an eventual decision that we would need to handle a small set of empty titles after all.  At that point I was able to actually deal with the problem.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Reproduce The Problem</h3>\n<p>After you define the problem, the next step is to reproduce it.  <strong>Do not skip this step.</strong>  If you can’t define and consistently reproduce a situation where the problem occurs, it will be impossible to know whether you’ve solved it.  If the issue involves a lot of specific circumstances and moving parts, or only occurs sporadically, this may be the hardest part of the whole process.  The things you want to keep in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the circumstances under which this occurs? Always? Only on certain browsers/OSs/hardware?  Is it a timing issue? A timezone issue? All of the above?</li>\n<li>Is there a series of actions that I can do that makes this occur every single time?</li>\n<li>Am I confident that I know all of the situations that cause this to occur?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answering #1 is the first step.  If you can say yes to #2 you’re in a fantastic position to proceed.  If you can say yes to #3, you need to get a lot more suspicious and cynical.  But the more confident you can be about each of these, the better equipped you’ll be going forward.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Narrow the Scope</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve established our problem and hopefully found a consistent path to reproduce it, we’re ready to start rooting out our problem.  </p>\n<p>The first step is to narrow the scope.  In a normal software environment, you’re likely to be dealing with a large amount of your own code, as well as 3rd party libraries and APIs, some sort of environment, and unpredictable user behavior.  That’s a lot of uncertainty and information to process.  I’ve seen developers who really try to understand the whole system before even thinking about the problem.  But in many cases that’s unrealistic.  Instead, you should be trying to get rid of as much of that information as possible by narrowing the scope of where the bug might exist.  There are 4 main ways of narrowing scope.</p>\n<h4>Prove That The Problem Is Unique To A Component</h4>\n<p>If you want to eliminate a system component from consideration, one good way is by proving that the issue is not unique to it.  This works particularly well for platform issues.  For instance, you might prove that something is not a browser-specific problem by showing that the issue occurs in all browsers.  This can give you some firm ground to stand on.  If you do expose a platform-specific issue, that can be good news too, as they tend to be better documented.</p>\n<h4>Follow The Flow</h4>\n<p>If your problem is a data issue (and many issues are), you can also narrow the scope by following the flow of data through your application.  There are 2 main ways to do this.  One is by starting at the beginning of the flow, where the data initially comes into the system, and follow it through, looking to see where things go wrong. You could also start at the end with the incorrect output and try to trace back and see where it came from.  </p>\n<p>A good debugging tool is a great asset here.  There may be times when you’re forced to work without one though (for example, working in an environment you don’t control or a domain-specific language without adequate tooling).  In that case you can get by with log statements, or even changing the code to output a result early.  Regardless, what you want is clear evidence that data was good at a certain point, or already bad at another.  This allows you to eliminate that code from consideration and focus in on the code before it.</p>\n<h4>Follow The History</h4>\n<p>If you know this problem was introduced relatively recently, you can approach it by figuring out what changed.  Version control systems in particular provide great tools for this type of analysis.  If you know that the change was introduced within a set period of time, that provides an additional dimension from which you can narrow the scope and filter ideas.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Make An Educated Guess</h3>\n<p>Now it’s time to make a guess at where the problem may be.  It’s important for this to be an <strong>educated</strong> guess.  You don’t want to check code at random.  Your starting point should come from your past experience with similar issues, or be the result of research into the problem. I can’t overstate how important research can be. It’s always worth starting with a quick Google search, since it might save you hours of time looking on your own.  Once you’ve narrowed the scope a bit, you can revisit your research, looking specifically for known issues with a specific component for instance.  Your guesses also can be a follow-up to new information from Step #5.  Despite the ordering I give here, debugging is never a completely linear process. You need to have all of these tools in your toolbox.  Experience will help you know which to use.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Understand The Behavior</h3>\n<p>If you’ve managed to isolate the unwanted behavior a bit and have a guess where the problem might be, now’s the time to read more deeply into the code.  What is actually happening in there?  Does the logic of the code match your understanding of its purpose?  Do you see any red flags or danger signs?</p>\n<p>I once interviewed a candidate for a programming job who told me he didn’t read code very much while debugging.  Instead he made changes to observe the new behavior and kept fiddling until the output worked the way he wanted.  While that might work for aligning text on a Wordpress site, you simply can’t get away with that in a complex application.  Reading and understanding code quickly is a skill, but it’s one you must develop if you want to be a productive developer.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Repeat Steps 3-5 until you have a thesis</h3>\n<p>If you’ve narrowed your scope and read some code, you might have an idea about what you think the problem is and how to solve it.  If you do, then proceed to step #6.  If not, take what you’ve learned and use it to loop back to step #3, to reduce the scope even more.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Test your Thesis</h3>\n<p>If you think you have a handle on the problem, now’s the time to test it.  There are a few ways to do that.  One obvious way is to apply a fix and see if the problem goes away.  But if the fix would be expensive in time, money or complexity or if you’re afraid of treating the symptoms rather than the disease, you can also look into creating a simpler test case.  </p>\n<p>Earlier this month I encountered an issue where a <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a> template was failing to render correctly occasionally.  After digging in and narrowing the scope, I determined that the issue occurred only on Chrome, and seemed to happen randomly after a few renders.  I was able to create a <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/w2gtm3yx/1/\">very simple test case</a> that reproduced the problem in a jsFiddle. I didn’t use any of my own data. Instead I just created the simplest test that I expected to fail.  And it did.  That gave me confidence that the issue was in the Handlebars-Chrome interaction, and I was able to find a workaround by looking through their <a href=\"https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/832\">issues page</a> on Github<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.  That type of iteration on your test cases also provides useful reference material in case the issue reoccurs.</p>\n<h3>Step 8: Repeat 3-7 until you can no longer reproduce</h3>\n<p>If your thesis turns out to be wrong, take your new knowledge and go back to step #3. It’s important to understand that this isn’t a rigidly structured process though.  This also may be time to go back and double check steps 1 &#x26; 2.  Do you really know what the right behavior is?  Have you learned anything that might change that?  If you couldn’t reproduce the issue after a change, are you sure that you’ve really fixed it?  Or were there holes in your original path to reproduce it?  A healthy amount of paranoia helps here.</p>\n<h3>Step 9: Document and future-proof</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve fixed the problem, or gotten to a point where you’re not going to continue for some reason, there’s one very important last step.  Document what you’ve learned.  If you made a change to the code that “looks wrong” but fixes the problem, leave a comment explaining it, and save it from future “code cleanups”.  If you can’t reproduce the problem consistently and it still exists, document what you learned in a bug tracker so that somebody can come back to it later.  If you isolated the problem to a 3rd party component, file a bug report and include your test case (simplified as much as possible).  If you created a useful test case, automate it or add it as a reference somewhere.  Exact processes will vary by team, but the key phrase here is “Those who don’t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.”  Are you going to bruise this bug or bury it?  Make sure you can fix the problem quickly if it happens again. If you can do anything to keep it from coming back, do it.</p>\n<h3>The Takeaway</h3>\n<p>Real world engineering means dealing with code you don’t understand.  That might be your coworkers’ code, a 3rd party library, a buggy video driver, or your own 3 year old code. To do that effectively you need a process.  That might be mine, or one of your own, it could be formal, or just built on habit.  But make sure you have one.  The ability to dive in quickly, understand what’s going on and create a fix will set you apart.  It’s not that hard, but it takes discipline, creativity, and most of all practice.  So go ahead and start fixing something.  Maybe you’ll be the <em>Problem Solver</em> next time</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Chrome 36.0.1985.143 seems to have resolved the issue.\n        <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/08/19/the-debugging-toolbox"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["javaScript","productivity"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"productive-js-dev","title":"Productive JavaScript Development","description":"An examination of what makes JavaScript development productive","layout":"post","path":"/2015/11/25/productive-javascript-development","date":"2015-11-25T14:43:46+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we as a JavaScript community can enable more productive JavaScript development.  Most of the major JavaScript libraries were created or popularized to further a theory of how we can be more productive.  jQuery emerged when the biggest productivity challenge for web developers was the incompatible implementations of JavaScript and browser APIs in different browsers.  It largely solved that problem.  Since then, Backbone advocates have pushed for greater productivity through libraries with minimal abstraction where users can understand the source code, Ember has created an ecosystem around the idea that “shared solutions” lead to greater productivity, Angular aimed to make developers (and designers) more productive by adding more power to concepts that were already familiar to them, and React is trying to improve productivity by simplifying the programming model around interfaces.  Meanwhile, tangential to the big frameworks, there has been work to enable more productive development through transpile-to-JavaScript languages (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Elm, ClojureScript etc), replacing JavaScript on the web period (Dart, WebAssembly, ASM.js), and improving the core JavaScript language while allowing developers to use new features early (ES6 and beyond, as well as Babel).  There’s also work to improve tooling around JavaScript with projects like <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern.js</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader\">Time Machine/React Hot Loader</a>, and continued improvements to Chrome and Firefox developer tools (along with Framework specific developer tools). So there’s no shortage of work being done in this area.  But let’s pull out for a moment.  What are the big picture things that affect productivity?</p>\n<p>Most of the time productivity tools are focused on one of 6 areas.  They make it easier to learn concepts,  easier to write code, easier to read code, easier to architect applications, easier to maintain applications, or easier to debug applications. Here are some examples of each</p>\n<h4>Easy To Learn</h4>\n<p>Angular and Backbone both try to improve programmer productivity by being easy to learn, each in different ways.  Angular puts much of its view logic inside HTML, a medium that many server-side developers and designers are already familiar with.  Therefore it’s a reduced learning curve than something like React, where the UI tends to be more spread across files and is mixed with JavaScript logic <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.  Angular also provides extensive documentation, which helps programmers come up to speed faster.  </p>\n<p>Backbone on the other hand, attempts to be easy to learn in two ways.  First, there just isn’t that much to learn.  Backbone is a small library with only 6 core concepts (Models, Collections, Views, Events, and Router) each of which should be familiar to developers coming to it from other UI focused frameworks.  That simplicity reduces the load on new users.  At the same time Backbone strives to have libary source code that is both short and readable.  It’s quite possible to read the code for the whole library in under an hour, and the core concepts are obvious when looking through the code.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Write</h4>\n<p>Ember.js aims to make it easy to write application code in at least 2 ways.  First it provides <a href=\"http://www.ember-cli.com/\">tooling</a> to help generate the boilerplate necessary for an ember application.  You can give ember-cli a model name and it will generate the file for that model in the correct place.  In addition Ember abstracts away many of the connections between classes so that you can load the correct files simply using naming conventions, resulting in less code.  </p>\n<p>The recent updates to the JavaScript language are about much more than just making it easier to write JavaScript, but several of the features are focused on providing cleaner syntax for common idioms.  Arrow functions in particular allow for maintaining the outer scope of a function in a clean way, when previously it required jumping through hoops that were easy to mess up.</p>\n<p>Redux and React Hot loader are an attempt to develop a programming idiom that allows for drastically reduced latency between making a change and seeing a result.  A React app using redux and a hot loader can be updated instantly without losing state and cycle backwards and forward through state updates.  Lower latency between writing code and seeing the results makes it much easier to iterate quickly towards good code.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Read</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest gains provided by React is an increase in the readability of code by combining all of the elements of a component (JavaScript, HTML and in some cases CSS) into a single file where the component can be read as a coherent whole without flipping through code.</p>\n<p>CoffeeScript is an attempt to strip out the unnecessary syntax bloat of JavaScript and focus on the pure logic.  Whether it succeeds is a totally different question, but it’s a great example of attempting to satisfy this side of the productivity problem by reducing the distractions in code.</p>\n<p>Type annotation tools like TypeScript and Flow also aim to increase code readability, but not by clearing out bloat (annotations can actually make the code feel more crowded and less readable at first).  Instead they add additional information to the code, making the structure and expectations of the code more apparent to a reader.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Architect</h4>\n<p>Ember really shines when it comes to making it easy to architect apps.  By providing clear guidance on how to structure apps, it can increase productivity by reducing bike-shedding.  In Ember every state of the UI is tied to a URL and each route is tied to controllers that display components.  Communication between components happens with actions and data is managed by Ember Data.  Thats a reasonable architecture thats general enough to work for most large web applications (Embers target).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately examples of innovation in this area are much more sparse than the others here, probably because it’s hard to demonstrate in a todo app.  There’s been a recent spate of interest in application architecture from all of the Flux implementations that have popped up for React apps.  I’ve also seen interest in the architecture model of <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/\">Elm</a>.  But most of the major MVC frameworks have much less community agreement on architecture than they do on smaller scoped issues.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Maintain</h4>\n<p>There are a lot of technologies around JavaScript that promise to make your code more maintainable.  Module loaders like requireJS, browserify and webpack, linters like ESLint and JSHint, type checkers like TypeScript and Flow, and test runners like Mocha and Karma all provide tooling around maintainability.</p>\n<p>At the framework Backbone addresses the idea of maintainability by keeping small and flexible enough to remain usable as requirements change.  React deals with it by simplifying the programming model enough that its easier for new developers to see whats going on.  And Ember deals with it by maintaining a disciplined process for continually improving the framework to “keep up with the web” without leaving developers behind.</p>\n<h4>Easy To Debug</h4>\n<p>In recent years a lot of work has gone into improving developer tools for debugging JavaScript. This has happened at 3 levels.  First browser vendors, especially Google and Mozilla,  have made a huge investment in improving the developer tools that ship with browsers.  It’s now possible to identify many errors quickly that would have been mere guesswork before.  Secondly, frameworks have worked on building their own developer tools.  React and Ember both have incredibly powerful debugging tools with first class support from the framework team.  Marionette (a framework for Backbone apps) has a similarly rich debugging tool, and Angular also has tools for debugging.  Finally, linters and transpilers are also helping to catch some classes of errors at compile time rather than waiting to discover them at run-time.</p>\n<p>Other than tools though, Frameworks can have some features that make them easier or harder to debug.  React and Angular both make a big deal of being easy to write tests for.  In Angular this is true because of their dependency injection system.  In React this works out because React components are basically pure functions that take state and properties and return DOM.  Pure functions are easy to test, especially compared to traditional UIs that are tied to the global mutable DOM. Backbone also contributes to easier debugging by presenting a relatively straightforward and readable source that developers can trace through without becoming baffled by “library mystery meat”.</p>\n<h3>Choices, Choices</h3>\n<p>When picking a toolset in JavaScript it’s helpful to think about all 6 of the above areas.  Any library or framework that has gotten past the minimum threshold of solving a problem will claim to help you in at least one of these areas.  But a useful comparison will run across all six.  What do you think are the best tools for a truly productive workflow in the JavaScript community today?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Not saying that this is the best way to make things easy to learn, just that it is a goal.\n        </p>\n        <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/11/25/productive-javascript-development"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["productivity","career"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"staying-productive","title":"Staying Productive","description":"Thinking through the environmental factors that lead to productivity","layout":"post","path":"/2016/01/25/staying-productive","date":"2016-01-25T04:41:46+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what makes me productive vs unproductive.  A lot of the time Software Developers tend to focus on their tools and environments when they think about productivity.  I’m certainly all into that, as you can see if you look <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">back</a>, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2015/11/25/productive-javascript-development/\">through</a>, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2016/01/11/the-most-interesting-atom-packages-ive-found-so-far/\">my blog</a>.  But in my mind the most important factors in building productivity are non-software related.</p>\n<h3>Setting Goals</h3>\n<p>By far the most important thing I’ve found for being productive was setting clear goals for what I want to get done.  Without goal posts to aim for, it’s hard to tell what you’ve really accomplished, and easy to get pulled off onto suboptimal tasks.  Goals are best set with a wider context in mind.  The act of setting and measuring goals tends to make us focus on those areas, so make sure your goals reflect your priorities.  If you set all of your goals around work, it can be easier to justify neglecting your family.  If you set a goal of writing every day, that might overwhelm time for exercising and keeping yourself healthy.  Therefore its helpful to set goals in a holistic way that allows you to judge what you value in the big picture.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical / Creative Tasks</h3>\n<p>I saw a great <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10959022\">comment</a> on Hacker News the other day that differentiated between projects and chores. The idea is that when you’re feeling productive you should work on projects, when you’re not you should do chores.  One of the biggest boosts to my productivity I’ve found was when I started categorizing work in my head as “mechanical” vs “creative” tasks.  Mechanical tasks (ie chores) are things that require little mental energy.  They’re well defined and possibly onerous.  Examples include filing email, documenting code, code reviews, and low-thinking code tasks like reproducing a client issue or adding a small well-defined feature.  Creative tasks for me tend to look like more involved code changes designing new features, or debugging client issues that aren’t obvious.</p>\n<p>I’m not universally energetic or productive.  Some days I can focus intently on a problem, other days I have the attention span of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSUXXzN26zg\">the dogs from UP!</a>.  When I’m able to focus, I intentionally put aside mechanical tasks, and leave them for times when I have less energy, continuous time or attention.  Oftentimes I’ll even put off higher priority mechanical tasks (or vice versa) to match my mental level to the task, because I end up getting more done sooner in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Productive Environments are a thing</h3>\n<p>It’s easy to think of productivity as a purely internal thing.  But the environment you’re in matters too.  For creative software work that means getting large blocks of non-distracting time.  That requires some intentionality.  I’ve been blessed with a workplace where I’m given plenty of flexibility.  That means that at times of high distraction-level (big projects, lots of meetings) I tend to actually do most of my work outside of the office, sometimes at weird times.  I use my time at the office for mechanical tasks and meetings, and do the creative work elsewhere.  That’s obviously suboptimal, and when I can I try to clear time during days to do creative work at the office and bunch the distractions.  However it works out for you, the key is to (as much as possible) group your distractions and leave large un-interrupted periods for creative work.</p>\n<p>Distractions can be self-inflicted as well as coming from others.  When I want to get stuff done, I try to listen to familiar music (oftentimes looping a single album for a few days).  I’ll also close Slack/Twitter/Email and other distracting apps.  Note that the distinction between mechanical and creative is important here.  When doing mechanical work, I’m fine having distractions around.  It’s only when I’m trying to harness mental energy that I care.</p>\n<h3>Day to Day work adds up</h3>\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/\">magpie</a>.  I love shiny new tools, projects, and ideas.  It’s very easy for me to get bored with a problem once I feel like I understand it.   I get excited by pouring effort into learning something new, not so much the hard work to finish the last 20% of what I’ve started.  What I’m slowly learning though is that it is my day-to-day work that makes an impact, not my crazy productivity binges.  Making things that last requires day to day dedication.  That also means maintaining focus.  The easiest way to waste day to day hard work is to spend it on a different thing each day.  There’s nothing wrong with trying new things.  But real productivity requires setting some priorities and sticking with them for a while.</p>\n<h3>Team matters more than the project</h3>\n<p>Finally, individual productivity doesn’t happen in a vacuum.  Who we work with can undermine or boost our results.  I don’t believe that it’s a small difference either.  I’d rather have a great team with no individually brilliant members than a bad team with one or two great programmers any day.  One of <a href=\"http://www.windsorcircle.com/about-us/our-values\">Windsor Circle’s values</a> is that teams survive longer than individuals.  The same can be said of their results.  Teams can magnify what is possible for a product.  Any individual has limits on what he or she can create.  Teams allow for those limits to be lifted by building on each others skills. At the same time, teams can limit each other by fighting, mis-communicating, distracting, or pursuing different goals.  So all of the other productivities ideas here can be applied just as well to a team as they do to an individual.  The best work comes from teams consistently working together towards a common goal over a long period of time in a constant and productive environment.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2016/01/25/staying-productive"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"large-improvements-small-team,ten-things-js,react-confessions","topics":["architecture","leadership","productivity"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"feedback-loops","title":"Feedback Loops","description":"How smaller loops lead to better software","layout":"post","path":"/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/","date":"2018/08/02","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>How do we get better faster?</em>  It’s amazing to consider the amount of money, thought and effort that has gone into solving that one simple problem in software development over the past 2 decades.  Here’s a small sample of buzzwords, trends and methodology that are concerned with reducing the time between making a change to software and seeing the results:</p>\n<p><strong>Agile -</strong> Agile is all about delivering working software sooner, so that you produce value faster and learn lessons quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD) -</strong> Test driven development is a process designed to let you know as soon as possible when a change has had the desired effect during development, and also sets up the conditions under which you know as soon as possible when a change has had an undesirable side effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Devops -</strong> Devops has been a push over the past decade to automate and control all parts of the software creation, deployment and maintenance life cycle.  Automation like continuous integration servers that run your test after every commit, chat bots that alert you based on site performance metrics, and servers that automatically build a copy of every branch for testing in a virtual machine are all examples of Devops being used to speed up the point when you know that a change worked or didn’t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Experience -</strong> This is a more recent buzzword that I’ve seen thrown around a lot in the JavaScript community, talking about improving developer tools.  Developer tool features like hot reloading, nicer error messages, specialized debugging and profiling tools, and fast build times all fight this same problem of getting a result as fast as possible.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Loops</h3>\n<p>All of these tools are concerned with <em>feedback loops</em>, the process by which developers, designers and product managers make changes, learn about the effect of those changes, and then iterate.  Teams with slow feedback loops spend a lot of time planning and thinking about every change, making sure to get everything right. They feel the cost distinctly each time they make a mistake, and it generally leads to a more cautious mindset.  Teams with fast feedback loops can plan too.  But they also have the option of taking a more experimental attitude and learning from their attempts. This can happen at multiple scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>developer</strong> can try out 5 different CSS rules in the UI in a few seconds if his UI is hot reloading and he doesn’t have to wait for a whole SCSS bundle to recompile</li>\n<li>A <strong>QA team</strong> can immediately know if somebody pushes a change that would breaks tests if they have a CI server set up to run tests against every new commit to each branch.</li>\n<li>A <strong>product team</strong> can see quickly that a new feature is problematic if he’s able to see detailed analytics on usage, instead of waiting to do enough user interviews to get a full picture</li>\n<li>A <strong>company</strong> can change direction if they ship an MVP early instead of attempting to wait and release the perfect product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Your Loops</h3>\n<p>As a developer who wants to make your product better, one of your best power moves is finding ways to speed up feedback loops.  Here are 4 suggestions for how to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions Early:</strong> One of the most important feedback loops for a developer is between yourself and the individual in charge of defining what you’re building.  If you simply take requirements from your PM/Manager/Lead/Designer/CEO/Client and go off and build your giant amazing piece of beautiful software, without any clarification, there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get to build it again, this time twice as fast without the budget.  Asking clarifying questions early prevents you wasting your time and exposes understanding gaps and technical barriers while there’s still a chance to deal with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Feedback as you go:</strong> Similarly, anytime you have a chance to get feedback on work while it is still in process from somebody who might object in the end, do it.  This means instead of building everything at once, work on smaller chunks.  This often takes time and thought, but the earlier you create <em>complete</em> chunks of code that can be evaluated and ideally shipped on their own, the more likely you are to ship something great in the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your environment:</strong> Have you spent time figuring out how to work as efficiently as possible?  Have you done it recently?  If not it might be worth re-evaluating your setup on a quarterly basis or so, figuring out what tools you can use to get quicker feedback, and also learning the shortcuts, tricks and new features for the tools that you do use.</li>\n<li><strong>Ship Code:</strong> Ultimately the best feedback comes when people are using what you’ve written.  Whether that’s compliments, bug reports, feature requests, anger or viral adoption, shipping will tell you things that you would never have been certain of while iterating on your own.  If you’re struggling to get code out, always fix that first.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"ten-things-js,favorite-interview,ll-context","topics":["architecture","productivity"],"category":"fe-architecture","key":"large-improvements-small-team","title":"Tips For Improving a Large Code Base With A Small Team","description":"How do you keep improving things with limited resources?","layout":"post","path":"/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/","date":"2018/01/07","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Over the last year I’ve been acting as the lone JavaScript resource working on a codebase with around 90k lines of JavaScript code.  That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>\n<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>\n<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>\n<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>\n<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>\n<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>\n<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>\n<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>\n<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>\n<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>\n<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>\n<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> and <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod\">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/\">pre-commit hooks</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>\n<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>\n<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>\n<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>\n<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/\">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I’ve gotten to work with plenty of non-devs who respect the need for good architecture.

It seemed generally applicable, so here’s a cleaned up version of what I shared.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What Is Value?</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to think of software engineering work as a series of task where you’re given instructions and you make the computer do what the designer / PM / CEO asked.  Or as a series of fun problem solving challenges that you’re somehow getting paid to complete.  Both of those views will eventually lead you to make suboptimal decisions when it comes to helping your business and growing in your role though.  Instead consider the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software Developers create value through shipping working code that solves important user problems in a predictable manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This captures a number of important things.</p>\n<h3>Shipping</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real Artists Ship - <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineer’s super power compared to other roles is that we get to build.  We create new things, add new behaviors, and ultimately (for a product company) control the shape of the product our company is built around.  This only has value when software actually ships though.  When we’re not shipping, it’s actually worse than just being slow to deliver value, because of a few non-obvious factors.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>unshipped code rots.</strong>  When we leave code in a branch 90% done, it doesn’t just stay the same.  It’s quite common for our situation to get worse.  Our teammates check in code that may cause merge conflicts, or worse just doesn’t take into account the unshipped code and sets us up for subtle bugs.  And when we do get back to the work we’ve often lost valuable mental context that makes any remaining work or testing harder and more error-prone.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we learn from shipping!</strong>  It’s quite common in software development for a developer or team to complete 90% of their feature according to the spec, only to find that they have another 90% of the work to go.  Doing the work to push things through to production inherently de-risks things, because we learn what the challenges are, and we know how long the work took.  Up until then, we will always have unknowns.  And when software goes out to users, we get to hear their feedback as well.  Shipped software lets us learn from our users (and from the performance of our system) and make adjustments that we wouldn’t have known about if we sat on the code.  </p>\n<p>So how do we get to shipping?  First, it’s important to push things through to completion rather than allowing ourselves to jump from project to project, making progress without finishing, and incurring a lot of cost from context switching.  Soemtimes this may mean imposing kanban style <a href=\"https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/\">work in progress limits</a> on ourselves.  Second, its often helpful to break things into smaller chunks.  Small code reviews are easier to complete, test, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/22/better-code-feedback\">review</a> and verify.  So multiple small changes will often go through faster than the same changes bundled together into a big chunk.  This can go too far, but as long as your changes work in isolation and provide value, I’d encourage erring on this side when in doubt.</p>\n<h3>Working Code</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[We Prefer] working software over comprehensive documentation - <em>The Agile Manifesto</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software engineers are responsible for their code working.  At the simplest level that means delivering code that doesn’t crash when run in the intended way.  As we grow and mature as developers however, we should aspire to  learn to write code that will scale to any reasonable load the system might see (and maybe even to unreasonable loads), code that handles odd input or context gracefully, and code that is easy to modify and maintain.  We should also take responsibility for proving that it works; writing tests, making the code easy to monitor in production, and providing good logging for debugging all fall under a software engineer’s domain. We also should make sure that our definition of working matches what the business needs, not just a pedantic reading of whatever spec we’re working off of.  More on that in a moment.</p>\n<h3>Solving Important User Problems</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just really funny- What the Customer Wanted expanded <a href=\"https://t.co/kdr7HKTSDy\">pic.twitter.com/kdr7HKTSDy</a></p>&mdash; Frank Spillers (@farreaching) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/farreaching/status/764256002053025792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineers can be quite inventive in the ways they write code without solving important user problems.  Some common routes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working on their own pet projects over the prioritized business problems</strong> - Tech improvement work and engineer-driven projects are part of a healthy organization, but if they consistently replace work that was scoped based on user requests / feedback, they can cause problems</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec without solving the original problem</strong> - This is partially a design/product problem, but its often possible to meet all the stated requirements for a project without solving the original user pain point.  Great engineers understand exactly what problem they’re trying to solve with a feature and will always step back to evaluate whether they’re succeeding throughout the development process.</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec and causing new problems</strong> - Oftentimes our efforts to fix cause or expose new problems.  When we dodge responsibility by ignoring or hiding those problems instead of openly evaluating tradeoffs or working to improve the solution, we’re not providing all the value we’re capable of. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are ultimately issues of ownership. When we’re invested in our work, we will want to work on useful problems and make sure they produce real value.  If you’re consistently not feeling that way, it may be time to find something else to work on.</p>\n<h3>In a predictable manner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources - <em>Fred Brooks</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, now we come to the section that is the <em>boring part</em> for many software engineers.  But as somebody who has recently converted to the management side of the fence, the ability to ship predictably is incredibly important.  </p>\n<p>It’s important for software engineers to ship predictably in 2 senses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of when something is likely to ship among the people who need to know</li>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of how something will work when it will ship among the people who need to know.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Estimating software engineering projects is not an exact science. Nobody reasonable expects estimation perfection from software engineers, especially those new to the field.  Instead we aim to be as accurate as possible, and especially to be transparent as those estimates change over time.  </p>\n<p>When we encounter obstacles, it’s important to be realistic about what they mean to schedules and update the important people in a timely manner. </p>\n<p>For those working on a product team that may be a manager and a PM, for those building something solo, that may be the customers or internal users of the software directly.  It’s never fun to say something is going to be late, but its always better to say that we’ll miss a date that is 2 weeks away than to tell somebody for the first time that you’ve missed the date that was 2 days ago.</p>\n<p>Communicating about the scope of work is just as important as schedule.  If we find out a piece of a feature is unfeasable or we dropped it due to time pressure, its important to communicate that.  Depending on your team/product, that may mean sharing with people directly, updating documentation, or just making the new behavior clear in an interface.   </p>\n<h3>It’s a process</h3>\n<p>Nobody starts out their first software engineering job with a fully evolved sense of how to estimate, scope and document their work.  Most have no clue how to think about building a system to be scalable or when to escalate problems to other members of the team.  These are skills learned through hard experience.  Make sure to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/05/18/obvious-things\">always be reflecting</a> on what you’re experiencing though.  Experience combined with reflection is a powerful mixture, and eventually will lead to growth.

This is a review of 2 books I’ve read recently; I’m combining them because their similarities and differences are just as interesting to me as the practical steps they encourage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR\">Deep Work</a> is a 3 year old book from Cal Newport focused on encouraging readers to spend more time on their most important work.  It starts out with sections defining and motivating “Deep Work”: focusing without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks.  Then it goes on to give a series of recommended strategies for creating more and better deep work time in your life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F0AIgV\">The Common Rule</a> is a new book by Justin Earley focused on building habits that allow living life with purpose.  It is a “Christian book”, and recommends practices like daily prayer and fasting.  But it is mainly focused on encouraging habits to combat some universal challenges of modern American life: distracting technologies, all consuming work environments, and increasing isolation.</p>\n<h3>A Shared Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>Deep Work and The Common Rule share a common view on the challenges facing many American adults today: they each tackle tech distractions, work expectations of constant availability, and time spent on shallow activities disconnected from our core goals and desires.</p>\n<p>Both authors are skeptical of modern “networking tools” like social networks, chat tools, news sites and email without dismissing them.  The primary issue both authors identify as the problem with technology is our non-critical acceptance of new tools into our lives as progress, the addictive nature of these services, and how they then impact our brains. Because we turn to technology for distraction and easy comfort whenever we’re bored, we lose our capacity for deeper engagement with the world and can lose sight of more important things.</p>\n<p>Each book also decries the problems with “constant connectivity culture”.  Deep Work comes at it from a pure productivity standpoint: expectations of constant availability create distractions that prevent us from getting into the flow of meaningful work, and when we’re answering emails at all hours of the day, we don’t get the context shifts where our brains can rest and help us be more productive later.  The Common Rule shares these concerns but is more interested in how these distractions can shape our thinking and emotions: when we get sucked into the world of social media news for instance, is the anger we feel about issues a reflection of our true priorities or a path that we’ve fallen down.  It also asks us to consider how long term media-consumption may shape these believes and not just distract from them.</p>\n<p>Finally, both authors touch on the amount of time we spend on meaningless activities.  Whether it is busy work, meetings, social media usage we feel we “have to do” or “real work” that just isn’t the most important work, both books encourage readers to value their time and be strategic about how to spend it.  They share a rare humble view of the human condition: we really do need to work with only 24 hours a day.  How to “make the most of them” is a core focus of each book.</p>\n<h3>A Suprisingly Similar Recommendation</h3>\n<p>In addition to a shared view of the problems people face, both books share a fairly similar approach to solving them.  Both books recommend ritualized structuring of life to reduce time spent on shallow, distracting activities and enable time for “the good life”.</p>\n<p>So… what is “ritualized structuring”?  Both books spend significant time outlying a series of recommended habits/rituals that combine to help make us more aware of how our time is spent, and also serve as enabling spaces for “the good life”.  Deep work recommends (among other things) structured work hours, work-free evenings, social media avoidance and end of the day “shutdown rituals” where you clean up todos and make a schedule for the next day.  The Common Rule advocates for taking an hour away from your phone each day, a meal with others each day, curating media to 4 hours each week as well as more obviously religious habits like daily prayer and a sabbath day.</p>\n<p>Each book offers these habits as “focusing tools”, ways to spend time on what is important and focus on the “good life”.  So what is the “good life”? Well…</p>\n<h3>A Subtly Different Motivation</h3>\n<p>The biggest difference between Deep Work and The Common Rule is what they’re aiming to enable.  What is the “good life” that we want to unlock as we wade out of the shallows?</p>\n<p>Deep Work sees “Deep Work” as both a good in itself and a means to career success.  Deep Work allows for craftsmanship and an impact on the world greater than we’re normally able to achieve.  And because it is both important and implicitly discouraged by the modern office environment, clearing space for it is a tremendous competitive advantage when it comes to career success.</p>\n<p>The Common Rule is explicitly focused on habits that turn us outward from ourselves; habits like a daily meal with others and a weekly hour of conversation with a friend are about connecting with the people around us, while daily prayer and weekly fasting are about connecting with God.  And ultimately they’re about health: when we connect well with God and others, we’re able to live in a way where we can accept our limitations and thrive where we are.</p>\n<p>I don’t think the 2 philosophies are incompatible per say: you can work efficiently at work while valuing your relationships, as long as you’re willing to accept the inherent limitations of the 24 hour day.  But reading these 2 books back to back reminded me that “efficiency” is never an end to itself.  It’s always important to make sure you’re heading efficiently in the right direction.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation</h3>\n<p>I highly recommend both of these books.  They are full of fantastic suggestions that I plan on implementing over time (I’m trying to avoid my classic blunder of trying to change everything about my life at once and look for bits and pieces to attempt first). But as you take in the ideas, make sure to reflect on what the “good life” looks like to you.</p>\n<h4>Amazon Links</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR\">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F0AIgV\">The Common Rule by Justin Earley</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"following-js-roadmap,fe-concerns,ten-things-js","topics":["javascript","career","productivity"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"how-to-learn","title":"How To Keep Learning JavaScript","description":"What you can do to keep getting better once you have a solid baseline.","layout":"post","path":"/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js","date":"2019/02/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>A member of my team at work asked me last week how I continue to learn things about JavaScript.  This is my answer. Note that it is focused on leveling up for folks with existing programming experience, not giving the best pathway into the field.</em></p>\n<p>I’m going to break this up into 3 parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The different ways people tackle learning new programming things</li>\n<li>An inventory of the different types of resources out there for learning programming</li>\n<li>My specific recommendations for JavaScript and React resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first 3 are going to be generalizable to any type of learning about programming you want to pursue (and probably other fields as well).  The last one is necessarily more specific.</p>\n<h4>Learning Strategies</h4>\n<p>It’s helpful to start by talking about the different ways that people learn programming concepts.  We can break things up into 3 categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practical</strong>:  This is where you work on projects and pursue goals, and learn the things you need as you need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Topical</strong>: This is when you commit to learning something about a certain set of topics that you think will be valuable.  This may be related to work you’re doing, but your goal is a deep understanding of the topic moreso than trying to solve a specific problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Serendipitous</strong>: This type of learning isn’t directed at all.  You’re just diving into learning as you encounter new terms or concepts, trying to absorb and understand everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So which one is best?  You’ll hear arguments for all three, but personally I see learning like investing; it’s a long term game that you can’t win in a day, the gains accumulate slowly until suddenly you’re a long way from where you started, and one of the keys is diversifying.</p>\n<p>Practical knowledge is safe; when you focus on learning things you need, you’ll rarely waste your time, will likely get more done, and will put yourself in a position to learn more interesting things as you develop a reputation for doing good work.  However focusing solely on learning the things you need to do your current job may blind you to trends and eventually leave you with an out of date skill set. In addition, while you may be looking for answers to practical problems, if your knowledge base is narrow to start you may miss out on innovative ideas because you don’t have exposure to solutions that might not “google well” for the way you think of your current needs.</p>\n<p>Topical knowledge can be very useful when jumping into a new area of work: sometimes you just need a level of exposure to the syntax, concepts and tools behind a language, framework or project before you can effectively work with it.  But learning about a topic divorced from a project can sometimes feel more productive in the moment than it actually ends up being: without practical experience of the pain points that the topic is solving for and/or causing, it can be hard to know what is important and make the connections that you really need. Topical learning can also devolve into a purely academic exercise where you never really learn to apply what you know.</p>\n<p>Serendipitous learning on the face of it is the most easily wasted; trying to learn everything can be overwhelming in programming, a field based on layers of abstractions, with a plethora of different subfields that can be explored for years without learning everything. However sometimes it is the dash of inspiration that comes from bringing previously disconnected ideas together that leads to the creation of something novel and great.  And those types of connection only come from somebody who is learning broadly as well as deeply.  Being curious also prevents the pitfalls of purely practical learning: dead-ends and blind spots. So there is a place for serendipitous learning too.</p>\n<p>The best approach is a mix of the 3: have real problems that you’re trying to solve, but make sure to keep an eye out for interesting things, and don’t be afraid of the occasional deep dive into a useful sounding topic.</p>\n<h3>Resource Types</h3>\n<p>There are so many ways to learn things in the programming world.  Below is a brief roundup of resource types, ordered roughly in terms of stability and how rapidly they produce new material.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Courses</strong> - College, bootcamps, Coursera, etc:  These are the ultimate in topical learning.  Not something that most people are doing every day, but can be great for rebooting a career if you want to head in a new direction or refresh after being away from the field for a while.</li>\n<li><strong>Books</strong> - People are still writing programming books.  These tend to fall into 2 categories: books about a specific framework or technique and more “timeless” books about some fundamental part of how we write software. The first group tends. to age fast but can be great for topical learning, the second are an essential resource for “higher level” thinking about our field.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Courses</strong> - In recent years, video courses seem to have grown in popularity as a way of teaching programming.  They’ve never been my cup of tea, but they can be great topical guides to new subjects for visual learners who don’t want to commit to a full academic course.</li>\n<li><strong>Wikis</strong> - There are several places online where developers aggregate documentation in an open way.  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> are the most prominent.  These can be an excellent authoritative source to start looking for answers that still are able to remain relevant as best practices and trends change.</li>\n<li><strong>Blogs</strong> -  Blogs come in a variety of flavors.  They can be focused profitable publishing platforms with multiple authors like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> or occasionally updates on a variety of topics from an individual developer.  They tend to be the best source for in depth “how tos” on niche topics that might not justify a book or be fully covered by a wiki.</li>\n<li><strong>Podcasts</strong> - There are lots of developer podcasts out there.  Due to the audio nature of the medium, they tend to be more focused on high level ideas and less likely to drift into the nitty gritty of code.</li>\n<li><strong>Newsletters</strong> - Newsletters like this one can be a great way to get regular updates from knowledgeable developers or receive aggregations of interesting links. I’ve personally found them more and more valuable in recent years as a way of bringing the best content to the surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Github/Looking at code</strong> - Sometimes the best way to learn is to go straight to the source.  We live in a golden age of open source software, where billions of lines of code are available for anyone to look at online.  Code is ultimately the source of truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Forums, Mailing Lists &#x26; Chat Groups</strong> - Many technologies, geographic areas and interest groups have vibrant online communities that can be a great source of learning.  In the past these groups tended to exist as mailing groups, IRC channels or forum sites.  But nowadays the most popular form of community seems to be chat groups implemented with Slack or Discord.</li>\n<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - These aren’t something that most of us can do regularly, but conferences are a great place to be introduced to new ideas and make connections with people in a tech community.</li>\n<li><strong>Meetup Groups</strong> - A more accessible option than conferences for many people, most mid-sized and larger cities have multiple tech meetup groups that can be a good place to grow a tech community and be introduced to new concepts</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregators</strong> - Aggregator sites like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> are useful places to encounter new ideas.  Compared to the options above, they’re much noisier; you’ll encounter a mix of content quality and topics.  But it can be a great way to find serendipitous ideas and find new blogs, podcasts and communities to follow.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - Social Media sites (especially Twitter) can be a great way to get a sense of whats on a tech communities collective mind, and encounter concepts and ideas while they’re still being formed.  But it also can be a distracting mess of noise.  So consider moderating your intake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d generally recommend a mix of the resources above, though you’ll find some are more helpful to you than others I personally have found that books, blogs, newsletters, wikis and aggregators have been the most useful for me personally, as well as finding ways to teach others through meetup groups, conferences and my own blog.  There is real truth in the idea that the best way to learn something well is to teach it.</p>\n<h3>Specific Resources</h3>\n<p>So the above stuff is all pretty generic.  I’ll end by listing some resources that I’ve found personally helpful in learning and keeping up with the JavaScript and React world.  This isn’t exhaustive, and I know there are a lot of great resources out there that I haven’t personally used.  But this is my list:</p>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix\">JavaScript Allongé</a> is a great ebook about functional JavaScript.  It was very influential for me in terms of how I structure my code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TTXlZt\">Effective JavaScript</a> is a bit dated now; it was written pre-ES6.  But it’s the best non-beginner book I’ve read about the JavaScript language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GNviXY\">Clean Architecture</a> is my favorite book on Software Architecture.  If you want to think about how we structure programs at a higher level, it is worth a read</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GPi6ll\">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> is a book I’ve mentioned a few times recently here; Its my new recommendation for a first “writing better code” book because its so concise.  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TRAPAl\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> played that role for me personally though, and I’d still recommend it as well for any developer who hasn’t read it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Atomic Design</a> is a great book on building modern design systems, and has been useful for me as I think about how to break down UIs in my development work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Video Courses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/\">Egghead.io</a> is the best source for dev video content I’ve found.  Video has never really been my jam, I prefer text content where I can go through it at my pace and easily reference back and forth between it and code.  But it can be great to get a focused intro to a topic, and Egghead seems to have nailed the format with its collection of short focused snippets. It’s mostly a paid service, but there is a bunch of great free content on there, especially beginner React stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Wikis</h4>\n<p>These are maybe stupid obvious, but I’ve learned more from these 3 sites than probably anything else listed here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> is the single best source for software development information on the internet.  Note that I would advise most people to use it as more of a googleable resource than a place to ask questions; they’re focused on documenting canonical answers to common problems moreso than chasing down situational issues, and for popular technologies they are fairly comprehensive.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN</a> is my site of choice for learning about browser APIs and JavaScript/CSS/HTML language features.  It’s extremely reliable, and generally very readable (although some articles are much more detailed than others).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> is a surprisingly great place to learn about general computer science concepts.  I wouldn’t use it for front end specific stuff, there are better resources there, but if I want to learn about a classical computer science concept like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue\">priority queue</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a> wikipedia usually has a pretty robust article giving the basic background.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Blogs</h4>\n<p>For blogs, I highly recommend getting a good RSS reader so you can keep up with posts as they come.  My tool of choice here is <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/\">Feedbin</a> for which I pay a very small monthly fee, but there are good free alternatives like <a href=\"/https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2ality.com/\">2ality</a> is a blog focused on new JavaScript features as they work their way through the TC39 development process.  It’s the best resource I know of for understanding what is coming down the language pipeline, and also learning about new features when they are released.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">Overreacted</a> is Dan Abramov’s “Advanced React” blog.  It’s the best single source of knowledge on React that I’ve seen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> is more of a mega-blog, with multiple articles published a day by a variety of authors.  It’s consistently high quality content, and even though it leans more towards “web site development” than “web app development” there is stuff here that anyone will find interesting.  It’s also been around a long time and has great historical resources for learning newish CSS standards like CSS Grid and Flexbox.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/\">The official React Blog</a> is excellent and a great place to get “official news” about React.  The same applies for other frameworks like Ember, Vue, and Angular; you always want to be following the official source and not just getting your news from the community.  It greatly reduces the chances of misunderstanding and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming\">cargo culting</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org\">benmccormick.org</a>.  Ok I’m sort of kidding here, but the truth is that having my own blog has been one of the best ways for me to learn; I learn when I write, I can reference back to older posts when I’m re-engaging with a topic, and things stick better when you write them down.  Plus when I write posts like this where I’m linking other resources, its easier for me to find those resources later. (but uh… feel free to tell everyone to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/subscribe\">subscribe</a> to my blog anyway)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Newsletter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a> is a great “list of links” style newsletter every week.  If you just want a pulse of the weekly news in the JS community, I think this is the best place to find it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/subscribe/\">Kent C Dodds’ Newsletter</a> is a great resource for React and JavaScript testing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">Hacker Newsletter</a> is a roundup of the top <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> posts each week.  Hacker News can be a bit of a mess (the comments are often written from deep within the startup bubble and the quality of links at any given time on the site is mixed) but it’s an amazing source of interesting content if you’re willing to wade through it.  This newsletter lets somebody else do that for you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://this-week-in-react.org/\">This week in React</a> is another source of advanced React content.  It’s actually just a summary of the interesting things going on in the React repo itself.  So if you’re interested in contributing to React or want to see how they’re progressing against their roadmap, it’s an interesting and quick read each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Aggregators &#x26; Social Media</h4>\n<p>Honestly, 2 years ago I probably would have led with this section; Twitter and Hacker News were a huge part of how I have found interesting content and built my skills over the past 5 years.  But I’ve gotten disenchanted with them over time as they became part of a broader issue of my increasing inability to focus on things because of the abundance of technology related distractions in my life.  So… caveat emptor.  That said here are some people I’d recommend following on Twitter if you’re interested in React and JavaScript.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>React</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\">Kent C Dodds</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\">Ryan Florence</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acemarke\">Mark Erikson</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">Shawn Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rauchg\">Guillermo Rauch</a></li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyleet\">Tracy Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_developit\">Jason Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slicknet\">Nicholas Zakas</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A final note</h3>\n<p>I just want to end where I started, and encourage you to not rush out and try to absorb all of these things at once, but instead work on projects and find the resources that give you what you need.

She’s an assistant professor who teaches writing to college students, and has found that her students pursuing technical degrees generally fail to see the value in learning to write.  The contrast between their expectations and my perspective after a decade working in software was strong.  I promised her at the time that I’d write down some thoughts on why writing skills are valuable for software engineers.  So here it is, 6 reasons that writing skills are crucial for working in the tech industry<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h4>1. You will write every day</h4>\n<p>Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside.  One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.  Here are a few types of writing that I’ve done daily or weekly for the last decade:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussing technical implementations through chat apps like slack</li>\n<li>Writing Bug Reports</li>\n<li>Writing comments in my code and technical documentation to help others and my future self understand what was done</li>\n<li>Writing reviews of other developers code to help our team improve and coordinate on best practices</li>\n<li>Answering questions from less technical employees or clients, often through email or slack.</li>\n<li>Creating design documents for complex work during planning times</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That list is illustrative but not exhaustive.  Any software engineer who wishes to build software that is used by others will end up doing plenty of writing.</p>\n<h4>2. The ability to explain complex topics will set you apart</h4>\n<p>The ability to take a complex topic and explain it in terms that somebody who doesn’t have all the background you do can understand is a critical one for software engineers.  This can help negate two of the most frustrating experiences for a developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A business asking for work that doesn’t make sense because the business folks don’t understand how the product works</li>\n<li>Less experienced members of the the team routinely making mistakes and breaking things because they don’t understand how the product works</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Senior engineers who can explain and document complex pieces of software save everyone frustration by helping junior members of the team understand how things work and be more productive, and by aligning business expectations and plans to the reality of how their software systems actually work.  These are hugely valuable activities that can make a big difference in your career.</p>\n<h4>3. Writing will help you find a (better) job</h4>\n<p>When I’ve interviewed software engineers, I see a variety of problems: they fail to present their strengths, don’t manage to show a sincere interest in the job, and get caught flat-footed on fairly standard questions.  Most of these mistakes come down to a lack of preparation, not tailoring their message to their audience, and not knowing how to structure the information they know about themselves in a compelling way.  These are the skills that you’ll learn from a good class on writing, and develop through practice writing.</p>\n<p>Interviews are important, especially early on in your career.  Your compensation as you go throughout your career tends to be anchored to where you started, especially if you stay one place for a long time.  An increase of $5,000 in salary on a job you take today would mean an additional $92,000 of accumulated income over the next 15 years assuming a salary increase rate of 3% a year<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition if you write publicly on a blog like this, it can help you show proof of your knowledge in a way that a resume never will.  Not everybody needs to be publicly blogging, but if that appeals to you it can be a great career booster.</p>\n<h4>4. Remote work increases the importance of writing</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest trends in the tech industry these days is the <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/remote-workforce-rise/\">rise of remote work</a>. More teams are embracing partial remote work, and there are major companies like Buffer, Invision and GitLab that are entirely remote.  Remote work is partially enabled by video chat technology, but written communication is the lifeblood of a successful remote team. Collaborating via tools like Slack, Github, Trello and Jira is part of most teams’ workflows, but when everybody is remote, being able to express yourself clearly on these platforms is critical.</p>\n<h4>5. Your career trajectory will depend on your ability to influence and persuade</h4>\n<p>Most developers when they begin their first software job will be given a set of tasks to do and the expectation is that they will create work to the spec that somebody else has designed.  They are implementors.  But as a developers career progresses there is an opportunity to be more than an implementor.  Since developers understand the system best, they often have ideas that can help shape product designs.  Developers also often need to work with other teams whose goals may not be completely aligned with their team.  These are not situations where even a senior engineer is likely to have direct authority.  Instead the developers who continue to grow in their careers are those who are able to influence and persuade without authority.</p>\n<p>This is again a skill that writing classes can cultivate.  Persuasive writing practice can help give you the clarity of thought and intuition for structuring arguments that will help both when you’re trying to make a point through writing or doing it verbally.</p>\n<h4>6. Writing skills translate to writing code</h4>\n<p>This last one is really specific to software engineering, but I’ve found that applying writing principles to code has helped me write more maintainable code.  Most code written in a professional context will be read many times by other people (or by the original author after they have long lost track of their original context).  Being able to write code that can be understood by both a computer and by human beings is a skill developed over time, but many of the same “brain muscles” that you develop in writing prose can be applied to code: it’s important to know your audience, structure your information in a logical manner, and use judgement when finding just the right phrase (or code structure) for a situation.  That could be a whole post in itself.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I write based on the tech industry and software development specifically because that is what I have lived, but most of these points should be equally applicable to any engineering career and would likely require very little modification for science and research as well.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Ok real world promotion rates in the tech industry are likely to be choppier than that, but the example holds.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"better-than-a-guess,herding-lions,management-resources-2-years","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"how-teams-go-faster","title":"How Teams Go Faster","description":"Spot on thoughts from John Cutler","layout":"post","path":"/2020/09/05/how-teams-go-faster","date":"2020/09/05","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I recently discovered John Cutler’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncutlefish\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://cutlefish.substack.com/\">blog</a>.

I’ve observed clear examples of several of these items personally over the last several years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I’ve seen my team go significantly faster <em>with less stress</em> by shifting projects to being serialized with pairing and collaboration rather than giving everyone their own project <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I’ve watched attempts to get ahead on planning be thwarted by changing business priorities.

I don’t think we’ve gone far enough in that direction yet.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some items I’d add to John’s list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manual QA / Deployments <strong>vs</strong> Test Automation as part of development<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>Senior devs filling up on feature work <strong>vs</strong> Senior devs mentoring, enabling and unblocking other devs<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Besides the creative and redundancy benefits of pairing, shared resources like PMs/EMs/QA become bottlenecks as you parallelize.  </p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This relates to the “handing off” QA point in John’s list.

It’s a common sentiment that has some truth but usually will make a manager start laughing or crying if you suggest that it represents reality.  Managing people well involves very little imposing your will on a situation and a lot more driving change indirectly.  The good news is that most of the techniques for this type of indirect change not only can be used by non-managers, many of them are actually more effective coming from engineers directly.  A lot of these techniques deserve posts of their own and I intend to keep these short, so consider this a brainstorming list for the next time you want to change something on your team and don’t feel empowered to do so.</p>\n<h3>Build the thing you want to exist</h3>\n<p>A software engineer’s ultimate power move is the ability to create new things.  If you’re in an argument on the best path forward for a project, just going ahead and building the thing you think should exist can be incredibly powerful.  This could be a proof of concept for larger things, or the full thing for smaller features.  Opposition and bikeshedding often melts away in the face of a working example of the future.  This is especially effective if the argument has been about whether your preferred solution is possible.  </p>\n<p>Note that this path can be overused, is helped along by a gentle touch, and I wouldn’t recommend it if you put so much time and effort into it that you’d be crushed if people still said no.  But it is a powerful way to move discussions forward.</p>\n<h3>Make it easier</h3>\n<p>Do you want everybody to write more/better tests?  Create some best practice examples and documentation.  Maybe make some training videos showing how you write tests.  Write some helpers to encompass common testing patterns.  Make sure your testing tools are updated to versions with the latest features, and consider whether there are different tools you can use to make adoption easier.  This type of work is also great for establishing yourself as an expert in the area (see below).</p>\n<h3>Make your preference a default</h3>\n<p>Similar to making it easier, you can often change behavior simply by making it the path of least resistance.  Want people to use spaces instead of tabs?  Encode that into a linter and set it to run against every Pull Request.  Want to make sure people add information to new issues?  Create an issue template.  Humans are very susceptible to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3930gJz\">nudges</a> and default behaviors, and are much more willing to accept new behaviors when they don’t require conscious action from them.</p>\n<h3>Identify allies and opponents</h3>\n<p>If you want to change behavior in your team, it can be helpful to have multiple people fighting for a change.  A great place to start here is just identifying who agrees with you.  Not everyone who is willing to accept a change might want to fight for it as much as you, but establishing an understanding of where people stand is helpful for you to identify potential allies as well as people who you may have to work harder to convince. </p>\n<p>When you know who <em>disagrees</em> with you, those people can actually be the most helpful in helping you move a change forward if they’re willing to give clear feedback, since they’ll help establish the conditions under which a team might accept a change.  </p>\n<p>If you find that you’re primarily fighting apathy rather than opposition, it can be a good time to pivot to other methods like “making it a default” or “show the future”.</p>\n<h3>Show the future</h3>\n<p>In his 1936 classic <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oZu7Yx\">How To Win Friends and Influence People</a>, Dale Carnegie said that one of the fundamental techniques in working with people was “Arouse in the other person an eager want”.  When we want to drive forward a change and are faced with apathy, often times the issue is that other people don’t understand why the change we’re advocating would be valuable for them. </p>\n<p>A great technique in this case is to be crystal clear on what we expect to get from the change — and to do so in a way that resonates with them.  If we want to have more automated tests, we might explain to our fellow engineers that more tests can help prevent future rolled back releases, resulting in less crunch time work.  Meanwhile, our product manager might be more interested to know that it will result in fewer angry customers and missed deadlines due to rework.  </p>\n<p>It’s important not to oversell here.  If you make it sound like adding a few tests will remove all quality issues with your product this route can backfire with the team quickly dropping support when the initial results underwhelm.  But understanding and explaining the “why” in a way that resonates with every relevant teammate is a powerful technique.</p>\n<h3>Ask authentic questions</h3>\n<p>When you are looking to change things and it feels like you’re the only one who sees the value in what you’re doing a great place to start can be asking authentic questions of others.  For instance, if we went back to our testing example you might ask “Do you think writing more tests would be valuable?”, “why do you think we don’t write more tests now”, or “how do you think our test suite should evolve from here?“.  </p>\n<p>If asked sincerely those questions will help you refine your understanding of the challenge in front of you, will open the minds of the people you’re asking toward the challenge, and may win some converts just by including people.  The sincerely part is important here though - people can generally tell when you’re actually listening to what they have to say versus including perfunctory “feedback requests” on your way to pushing an agenda.</p>\n<h3>Work in “public”</h3>\n<p>When you’re trying to encourage a particular practice it can be helpful to demonstrate the work “in public”.  So if you want people writing more tests, share screenshares of yourself writing tests, run a brown bag lunch where you do some live coding, or share your test PRs in a public slack channel where people will see it.  You might even write public blog posts about the work you’re doing, or speak about it at a meetup.</p>\n<p>There are a few goals here: to show people what it looks like to do the work, to “normalize” the practice, and to give it visibility.  Doing work publically like this can be a way to attract other interested folks who you might not have expected to be sympathetic, it can raise your own profile, and it can be a way to get great feedback.</p>\n<h3>Explain your work</h3>\n<p>One mistake I see people who are trying to drive change make is an assumption that everybody understands what they’re doing.  When you’re first introducing a new technology, process, or improvement to your team you should always assume that you need to make the case for it, starting with clearly explaining what the change is and what you’re intending to accomplish with it. </p>\n<p>This technique can be combined with many of the other ones here, and can be accomplished in many ways.  A short RFC style document where you outline the change you want can be great.  Putting extra detailed comments and descriptions into pull requests where you’re implementing a desired change can be helpful, as can screencasts, blog posts, or brown bags.  For smaller changes this may just mean going out of your way to be extra explicit about the “why” when you make pull request comments requesting people to move in a certain direction.</p>\n<h3>Establish your expertise</h3>\n<p>As I said at the beginning, “change by authority” is not generally the best path.  People are happier doing things because they see the value, not because somebody told them to do so.  That said, sometimes change does need to come through authority.  When that is the case though, there are two types of relevant authority in most engineering organizations.  Hierarchical authority (IE directives from somebody with a managerial title above you in a reporting relationship) and expertise authority.  While hierarchical authority changes slowly and comes with all sorts of other pros and cons, anyone can develop the authority of expertise with a level of dedication and work.  </p>\n<p>If you want to drive testing culture on your team it can be helpful to establish yourself as an expert on testing.  The bar for this might be quite high or quite low depending on your existing culture, but the path is similar either way; do the work consistently over time, educate yourself, and demonstrate the impact of the work you’re doing.  A little bit of this might not go very far, and if the organization explicitly doesn’t value the change you’re trying to make it is possible that expertise won’t change the equation here.  But if there is willingness to consider growth, establishing yourself as an expert will ensure that you will be part of the conversations when it is time to make a change, and you’ll get to contribute to making change happen.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/01/19/driving-change-without-authority"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"how-teams-go-faster,herding-lions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"play-other-positions","title":"Play Other Positions!","description":"A sports lessons for software careers","layout":"post","path":"/2021/01/01/play-other-positions","date":"2021/01/01","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>This fall <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29853800/i-was-wide-open-how-ben-roethlisberger-season-receiver-helped-qb\">ESPN published an article</a> about Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger’s high school stint as a Wide Receiver and how it benefited him as he moved forward in his career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before he set records as a quarterback his senior year, before he became the Pittsburgh Steelers’ top draft pick out of Miami (Ohio), and before he won two Super Bowl rings as one of the NFL’s best signal-callers, Roethlisberger spent his junior year of high school playing wide receiver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It gave Roethlisberger a deeper understanding of the game he took with him the rest of his career — something he found again last season as he stood on the sideline following a season-ending elbow injury in Week 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”[Findlay] coach [Cliff Hite] was always like, ‘It benefited you as a senior playing quarterback from playing wide receiver your junior year,’” Roethlisberger said. “I never understood it at the time, but I think it does to a certain extent because you can see the other side of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article highlights 2 advantages of the previous receiver experience for Roethlisberger.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roethlisberger’s stint as a receiver enables him to be clear with his instructions. Nothing gets lost in translation when the quarterback can give his directives in a way the receiver clearly understands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He can talk our language,” said Ryan Switzer, who played with Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh for two seasons. “He can talk leverage, he can talk technique, he can talk lean and press, he can talk all these things, which makes the communication a lot more fluid between us and him. … He’s able to communicate really well, which helps translate to being on the same page more often on the field.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The carryover from one position to another goes beyond communication. Iriti sees it in the way Roethlisberger eludes the pass rush and finds a receiver on a broken play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s like he knows where he’s at, and he knows where you’re trying to go, so he can wait until that last second, just make that little move,” Iriti said. “It’s not fast, it’s not quick, but it’s like it’s premeditated that he knows where you’re going. So it makes him seem more agile and quick than he actually is. He’s not a blazing-fast guy, but instinctively he’s really smart.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Playing a position that he later had to collaborate with allowed Roethlisberger to communicate with his teammates better and make better adjustments when things went wrong and he needed to understand or anticipate his teammates reactions. </p>\n<p>Reading Roethlisberger’s stories reminded me of some of my own practices as a high school basketball player. Our coaches would force us to switch positions around when practicing plays.  The theory was that you didn’t really know a play until you could execute on every position’s part of it.  As a tall but gawky and uncoordinated high schooler, I was never likely to move away from my forward position to become a full time point guard, but the exercise was useful both for the reasons called out above, as well as the flexibility it gave us to play different lineups for shorter stretches during a game.  If we had problems with injuries or foul trouble, we could get away with playing people at a different position for some stretch of time, or play different groupings of players that let us take advantage of matchups.  </p>\n<p>So what does any of this have to do with the purported topic of this blog, productive software teams?  It turns out that modern software teams have a lot in common with sports teams.  They’re a collection of individuals with different skillsets who take on different roles to work together towards a set of goals over time.  Our work has less black and white scorekeeping, and the lines between “games” are a lot blurrier, but there is a lot we can learn from the world of sports. </p>\n<p>The lessons from my high school basketball days have stuck with me as I’ve progressed through my software career.  I find that I collaborate better with my teammates when I have some sense of what it is like to do their job.  A benefit of spending the last 7 years in startups was the opportunity to wear a lot of different hats on a short term basis.  I’ve always done an mix of front end and backend development. I once was assigned the role of being primary test engineer for a major release while our normal QA lead was taking a few weeks off out of the country.  As my career advanced I got to get more involved with the product management side of things, collaborating closely with PMs to help shape how products got built.  I even spent a memorable and painful couple months as my team’s primary designer after a round of layoffs.  As both an individual contributor and an engineering manager, these experiences have helped me work well with a variety of different people, identify times when teammates in different roles were talking past each other, and plug gaps when the need arose. It also gives me empathy for people who are facing the tough parts of their job, and a level of humility when approaching discussions that comes from knowing there are always many perspectives on a particular problem or process.</p>\n<p>Unlike sports, we don’t usually consciously “practice” in software development.  That may be a mistake, but given it is the world we live in, how do we actually develop this type of experience?  I’ve found 3 primary things helpful: doing the work, talking with people experienced in the role, and reading about the role.  This isn’t that different than the learning process if you actually wanted to pursue a particular role, the time commitment is just lower.</p>\n<p>If you have the ability to just do a piece of a project in a different role or fill in for someone for a short time, that can be the easiest way to quickly develop some intuition about a role.  For some role combos that’s pretty easy.  A software engineer can always take a shot at doing more of a test engineer role.  Look at another developer’s code and think about how you would test it. You probably won’t be doing what a full time test engineer would do, but just getting into the mindset can be helpful.  It can feel harder to cover other roles - how would you “try out” being an engineering manager as a junior engineer?  But you might be able to ask the person in that role if there’s some part of their job you can help them with.  Then you get to try out a piece of the role and potentially get some guidance to go with it.  </p>\n<p>One problem with “just doing it” is that when we first try a new skill or role, we don’t know what we don’t know.  It’s easy to perform a parody of the role if we don’t get any meaningful feedback on our performance.  So it is helpful to talk with somebody who is experienced in the role, ideally an expert.  They can give you feedback on your attempts or just tell you about what they do and how they see the world.  The ability to listen well and ask good questions can take you far here. </p>\n<p>Finally, there are a lot of written resources out there for learning about different roles.  To help work with people in a certain role it can help to read some of the “classic” essays or books about a role.  A learning-focused person in the role will be able to make recommendations, but if you don’t have a good resource there you can get a similar effect with careful googling for “best books for product managers” or similar.  Some books I’ve found helpful for understanding different roles include <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KVewdZ\">Inspired</a> for product managers, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hx6Iee\">The Manager’s Path</a> for engineering managers, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hyC6ca\">The Design of Everyday Things</a> for product designers.</p>\n<p>For pretty much every piece of career advice out there, there are pathological variations that should be avoided.  Almost everything can be taken too far or stripped of context to the point where it becomes harmful.  I’ve seen at least one common way that the pursuit of understanding our teammates roles can go wrong.  That is simple ego; it can be tempting to believe that because we’ve walked a mile in somebody’s shoes we’re the experts and our voices should now hold heavy weight when making decisions in our teammates area of expertise.  We should always be listening to our teammates and taking in different opinions. However, it is still valuable to have “owners” for a role, and spending a week or a month or even a year working in a role is not the same as making it your career.  There are going to be times where a more experienced team will need to support somebody in their role, especially if they’re new.  But that’s not the same as you “being able to do it better” or “having veto power”.  This can get quite bad; I’ve known engineers who genuinely believed that they could step in and do any role in their company better than the people who had made it their careers.  This is the opposite of the empathy we’re trying to create.</p>\n<p>I’m wary about aggrandizing this advice.  Trying other roles is a simple technique for working better with your teammates and it isn’t going to change the world.  But I’m writing this on the first day of 2021.  2020 was a year that was marked by a lot of suffering and struggle across our world, and also one that seemed to me to lead many people away from empathy and connection and toward conflict.  Consider this as a simple way to build empathy and connection with your teammates this year. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/01/01/play-other-positions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"how-teams-go-faster,play-other-positions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"change-without-authority","title":"Engineering Management: What do EMs do anyway?","description":"The activities of an Engineering Manager","layout":"post","path":"/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do","date":"2021/02/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>I’m currently taking some time away from my job on parental leave, and it seemed like a good time to reflect on the lessons I’ve learned the last few years about engineering management, starting with a base assumption of what it is that engineering managers actually do</em></p>\n<p>There are a lot of different ideas out there about what engineering managers actually do, from pithy one liners like “nothing” or “meetings” to detailed expectations that sound like a superset of tech lead, project manager, and people manager roles.  When I got started in management I quickly found that at fast growing companies people will happily flow as much work as possible to EMs, and it’s important to have a clear idea of what your job really is, because the workload will quickly become larger than one person can do — at which point effective managers excel primarily because of good time management and prioritization.  Those skills start by understanding your core responsibilities.  </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZvSXnP\">High Output Management</a> Andy Grove summarizes a manager’s output as the sum of the output of his team and the output of neighboring teams that he influences.  A manager’s goal then is to maximize those outputs — a framing that is helpful to come back to when it comes to prioritizing work.  Making good choices of what to work on is a different article, but for now I’d like to consider a semi-comprehensive list of the different areas a manager can focus to influence those outputs. In my career and reading I’ve seen a pretty consistent set of 3 high level areas that effective managers invest in: facilitating information flow, driving progress forward, and building a sustainably productive team. </p>\n<p><strong>Facilitating information flow</strong> includes a mix of information gathering and information sharing.  Engineering Managers are responsible for doing the work to understand what is happening in their team and also understand what is happening in the broader organization.  Effective EMs then find useful ways to synthesize and share that information to help their teams be more effective and give other teams and executives clarity into what is happening with their team.  There are a multitude of anti-patterns here including undersharing or oversharing in either direction, manipulating people via information flow, and failing to extract and emphasize the most critical pieces of information.  But doing this right means bringing clarity to everyone an EM works with, pushing the most important information to the people who need it and making it easy for people to pull other information when needed.</p>\n<p>Tools for facilitating information flow include 1 on 1 meetings, building or advocating for processes and tools that expose team and project status clearly, encapsulating decisions and reasoning in documents that can be shared widely and referenced later, and asking good questions in standups and project meetings that lead to better understanding of problems and any misalignments between the team and the business.  Getting good at this stuff means being a good written and verbal communicator, keeping an attitude of curiousity and humility that lets you learn from others and stay up to date with what is going on, and being intentional about building relationships with all of the key people you work with.  </p>\n<p><strong>Driving progress forward</strong> breaks down into 3 parts: decision influencing, delegating/monitoring and “doing the work”.  The first item here is phrased as <em>decision influencing</em> rather than decision making because while you will have to make many decisions as an Engineering Manager it is even more common and in many cases more desirable that you’ll be providing input and influence on decisions but not ultimately “owning” the decision yourself.  Delegating work to others is an important part of getting things done and scaling yourself as a manager, but to again quote Andy Grove “delegation without follow-through is abdication”.  So even delegated tasks still require the work of monitoring and supporting, and thus take time.  Finally, EMs sometimes take on work that is actually directly part of their teams day to day — writing code for a feature, designing architecture for an upcoming project, or debugging a production issue.  That last point is the most controversial — there are plenty of “engineering managers shouldn’t code” zealots out there.  I simply add it here as something an EM <em>can</em> do to increase their team’s output.  Whether it is an effective or impactful activity is going to be highly context specific and is out of the scope of this article.  </p>\n<p>Progress on a team’s work has the shortest feedback loop of the 3 top level areas: missing information can often go unnoticed for a while, and unhappy teams’ troubles may take a while to manifest.  But everybody notices when your team is not succeeding at it’s goals.  Thus the anti-patterns here are often trading off team and communication for an appearance of progress: doing too much work yourself at the expense of your team’s development and long term scalability, failing to take responsibility for your team’s output — often by delegating without supporting a teammate, or making decisions that optimize for making yourself look good at the expense of your team or other parts of your organization.  Getting really good at driving progress as an engineering manager means learning to delegate with an appropriate amount of support and monitoring, learning how to influence work usefully without having to own it end to end and being strategic about what you yourself try to own.  </p>\n<p><em>Building a sustainably productive team</em> involves a mix of hiring, culture shaping, team development, and what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rands\">Michael Lopp</a> calls the <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/#:~:text=care%20and%20feeding%20of%20engineers\">care and feeding of engineers</a>.  Hiring new engineers is arguably the highest leverage activity we undertake as engineering managers — it’s a one time process that will have impacts on your team for years.  Engineering managers have outsized influence on their team’s culture: what work is valued, what the expectations are for meeting preparation and timeliness, how people are treated, what type of people and ideas are welcome.  This is often influenced as much by what EMs neglect as what they do.  EMs can help their teammates develop through thoughtful feedback, coaching, sponsorship and training.  And we work in an industry where our teammates usually have many great work options — setting aside the moral case for being a compassionate manager, managers that do not care for their employees, understand their needs, concerns and ambitions, and help them thrive are unlikely to develop a sustainably productive team over any length of time.  </p>\n<p>The biggest anti-pattern here is simply neglecting the work — I’ve worked for and around managers who simply didn’t take the time to regularly talk with their team, were not mindful of the impact their actions had on culture, or treated their employees as replacable cogs in an industrial machine.  Even hiring is often not given the investment it deserves based on impact: many managers are content to offload sourcing and evaluation to other people or put minimal time into preparing for interviews and new job postings.  Getting really good at building a sustainable team means thinking of yourself as a role model for the behavior you want to see, investing heavily in hiring and supporting your current team, regularly giving and seeking meaningful feedback and being organized about helping your team in their career growth.  </p>\n<h3>It’s all about outcomes</h3>\n<p>I labeled this list as semi-comprehensive because while most of the valuable work I do as an engineering manager falls under one of the categories above, managing engineers is fundamentally different than the type of work someone who has just been promoted from a mid-senior engineering role might be used to.  Instead of taking tasks or projects to completion, you’re now operating at a level of an organization where the expected deliverables get a little hazier and you’re being asked to achieve higher level business outcomes.  </p>\n<p>So don’t be afraid to shift the time you spend on different parts of this list over time or even do work that seems a bit far afield from your role.  If it’s grounded in a desire to produce good outcomes for the business and help your team and it won’t get done without you stepping in, consider it part of the job.  </p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-art,vim-language","topics":["vim","productivity"],"category":"tools","key":"vim-files","title":"Vim Workflows: File Switching","description":"A look at the different approaches you can take to managing files in Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies","date":"2014-11-10T04:06:52+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Becoming productive in Vim is about more than just knowing all of the features available to you<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. It’s all about knowing which ones to use in which situations.  In my series from this summer on <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">learning Vim</a>, I focused a lot on the different tools Vim provides for solving problems.  Today I’ll show how I put some of those tools together to actually be more productive.</p>\n<p>A good tool should allow you to focus on your problem while using it, without making you spend a lot of time thinking about extraneous things. File switching is an area in text editing that can really slow you down if you let it.  The first file switching method that most Vim users is the simple <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command to open a file.  Technically it’s the only command you need for file switching, since you can use it to open up any file you want and start editing it.  But doing so requires you to essentially internalize the complete structure of your file system and type out full paths every time.  On a large project with nested directories that becomes a significant mental load and use of time, even if you’re taking advantage of Vim’s tab completion features. And it’s a mental load that’s inessential to the task at hand.  You need to recall the precise layout of your file structure every time only because the tool isn’t able to make things easier for you.</p>\n<p>Fortunately Vim is able to make easier things easier for you when you use the right tool for the job.  That means rather than using one file switching strategy to rule them all, we can combine several tools to reduce the mental load on us and focus on our code or writing. I’ll specifically look at a few common scenarios and my approach for each.  This isn’t the only workflow you can use to address these scenarios, but hopefully it will inspire you to improve your own Vim workflow.  So here are the different scenarios:</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file with a name I know</h4>\n<img src=\"ctrlp\" class=\"full-width\" alt =\"ctrlp screenshot\">\n<p>When you’re moving to a file with a name that you know, it’s hard to beat the power of a fuzzy finding plugin like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a>.  CtrlP allows me to type in the name of a file without remembering or typing a long directory path and instantly get a list of potential files.  Usually the file I’m looking for is the top hit.  </p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file, but I don’t know what it’s called</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75.6190476190476%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"NerdTree screenshot\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/a9e6e/nerdtree.png\" srcset=\"/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/40f08/nerdtree.png 143w,\n/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/d4502/nerdtree.png 285w,\n/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/a9e6e/nerdtree.png 570w,\n/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/c2e96/nerdtree.png 855w,\n/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/f4f98/nerdtree.png 1140w,\n/static/f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a/44231/nerdtree.png 2100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p>This scenario happens most often on projects that you’re unfamiliar with and just getting into.  You’re looking for some functionality, but don’t know exactly what it’s called within the project and need to look through the file system for hints.  In this case you need a directory browsing tool.  Vim bundles <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075\">netrw</a> by default and it’s a good starting place.  If you have issues with netrw, many people install <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a> as an alternative file explorer.  I personally don’t use NerdTree very often these days.  Most of my work over the last year or so has been on one large project or smaller experimental projects and I haven’t needed it.  But it’s been very useful when I’ve cloned down a github repository to look it over or make changes.  It’s the best way to quickly get the lay of the land of a project within Vim, and to find a specific file before you really know what you’re looking for.</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file that I already have open</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Buffer list\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/a9e6e/bufferlist.png\" srcset=\"/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/40f08/bufferlist.png 143w,\n/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/d4502/bufferlist.png 285w,\n/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/a9e6e/bufferlist.png 570w,\n/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/c2e96/bufferlist.png 855w,\n/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/f4f98/bufferlist.png 1140w,\n/static/889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd/77a98/bufferlist.png 2080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p>A common scenario in Vim involves moving back and forth between 2 files, possibly a file and its corresponding test file.  If you don’t want to use splits, that means you’ll want a quick command to move between open files.  Fortunately Vim keeps a list of active buffers open.  When I’m only flipping between 2 files I’ll usually use the <code class=\"language-text\">:bprev</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bnext</code> commands, which I’ve aliased to <code class=\"language-text\">[b</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">]b</code> <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. If I have more than a few files open though I’ll usually either use <code class=\"language-text\">:b</code> and type the name of the file, or just use ctrlp again, which doesn’t require me to remember if the file I wasn’t is actually already open or not.</p>\n<h4>I want to move back to the place I just was</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"indy\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/c8bb8/indy.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/5f247/indy.jpg 143w,\n/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/531b1/indy.jpg 285w,\n/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/c8bb8/indy.jpg 570w,\n/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/3b53c/indy.jpg 855w,\n/static/46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717/1f853/indy.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p>“Rabbit Holing” happens to me all the time when I’m working on code.  I start looking at one thing, then look at code related to that, and before I know it I’m 4 files deep following a chain of stuff I’m debugging.  Oftentime I want to move back up that chain.  I could of course remember what files I opened and use one of the methods above, but that requires me to internalize the memory of events.  The command that maps best to my desire to move back up the chain is using Vim’s jumplist.  Vim keeps track of every “jump” you make within a window or split, and allows you to move back up and down that jump list as you like, both within files and across them. The commands to move up and down the jump list are mapped to <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-o&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-i&gt;</code> by default.  When I use them I don’t have to keep track of what files I’m moving across or even if I’m switching files at all.  I can just investigate my issue and have confidence that I’ll be able to get back.  Think of it as tying down a rope before you dive into a cave full of snakes.</p>\n<h4>I want to create a new file</h4>\n<p>Creating a new file means that we finally find a use for the basic <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command.  Because you need to specify a full directory path anyway when you’re creating a file, it makes sense to use the basic Vim commands here.  If you need to create a directory to put the file in, you can use the shell command with <code class=\"language-text\">:!mkdir &lt;path/to/dir&gt;</code>.  While writing this piece I learned that ctrlp has the ability to create a new directory path and file in a single command, which is a nice touch.  But you lose out on Vim’s autocompletion of paths if you’re creating a directory nested in existing directories.  I find the builtins to be simplest here.</p>\n<h4>I want to edit a specific piece of code, but don’t know what file it’s in</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.75988428158149%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Ag.vim\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/a9e6e/agvim.png\" srcset=\"/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/40f08/agvim.png 143w,\n/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/d4502/agvim.png 285w,\n/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/a9e6e/agvim.png 570w,\n/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/c2e96/agvim.png 855w,\n/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/f4f98/agvim.png 1140w,\n/static/a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd/5fccb/agvim.png 2074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p>Finally, possibly the most common scenario for me is when I know I have a particular piece of code I need to edit, but don’t have it mapped to a particular file in my head.  Rather than forcing myself to recall the file, the easiest path is to let Vim take the information I know and help me out.  Specifically I use Ag.vim for code search within projects.  It is a wrapper around Ag, a <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">fantastic code search program based on Ack</a>.  It allows me to enter a search term, and then pulls up all occurrences of that term within my project.  One of it’s best features is filtering by file type, which allows me to type something like <code class=\"language-text\">:Ag --less &quot;\\.widget&quot;</code> and search my LESS files for all rules effecting the class <code class=\"language-text\">.widget</code>.  </p>\n<h3>Let Vim Work For You</h3>\n<p>The workflow I described is not the “one true way” to navigate files in Vim.  Some people hate plugins and will prefer to use <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:b</code>, and netrw for everything. You can certainly do many of the things above with NerdTree or CtrlP if you prefer to simplify to one tool.  And <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a> is an attempt to pull almost all of these scenarios into one tool.  The point is to be aware of the inessential work created in the different scenarios you face when coding and offload the work to Vim in a way that makes sense to you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/\">Oil and Vinegar</a> is a nice Vimcasts article on how to make NerdTree work well with multiple splits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I wrote a more <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/07/learning-vim-in-2014-working-with-files/\">introductory post</a> this summer on the tools you can use to manage files in Vim.

I don’t completely love it.  There are elements (startup speed, maturity of some core editing components, not being able to run it in a terminal) that I miss from my experiences with Vim and/or Sublime Text.  I’m using Atom though because the core editing experience is now “good enough” and the way the editor is built allows for some very cool and unique experiences.  Atom (like <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>) is built on <a href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\">Electron</a>, Github’s JavaScript environment for building desktop apps.  Because it is built with web technologies and was designed from the beginning to be extensible, it is much easier for most developers to build rich visual extensions on top of Atom that provide unique UIs for editor functions than it is in Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs or an IDE.  The following are some of the “most interesting” Atom packages I’ve found.  Interesting in this case means that they really only could have been done as they are in Atom or a similarly flexible editor.</p>\n<h3>Pigments</h3>\n<p>At first use, <a href=\"https://github.com/abe33/atom-pigments\">Pigments</a> seems like a pretty run of the mill color highlighter.

So users can distinguish between (for instance) completions offering a snippet, a function, a keyword, or an import.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.07629427792916%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"autocomplete-plus\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png\" srcset=\"/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/40f08/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 143w,\n/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/d4502/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 285w,\n/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 570w,\n/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/c2e96/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 855w,\n/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/f4f98/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 1140w,\n/static/f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556/f3171/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom.png 1468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p>Autocomplete-plus is also a great example of the flexible nature of Atom.  Because Atom itself is made up of packages, with a very small core package, it’s easy to replace key parts of the editor like the auto-complete package with a community version.  And if that version ends up being better in the long run, it’s possible to pull that into the editors core, as happened with autocomplete-plus.</p>\n<h3>Todo-show</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/todo-show\">Todo-show</a> is a cool little package that searches your project for comments containing TODO, FIXME, CHANGED, REVIEW and other configurable comment strings, and lists them as a table.  It’s a simple idea that formalizes something that many developers do all the time.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.18546365914787%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"todo-show\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png\" srcset=\"/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/40f08/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 143w,\n/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/d4502/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 285w,\n/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 570w,\n/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/c2e96/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 855w,\n/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/f4f98/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 1140w,\n/static/c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a/b1d90/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Twitter has pointed out this even crazier riff on this concept that I’d seen a while ago but had been unable to find when I dove back into Atom.  <a href=\"http://imdone.io/\">Imdone</a> is a trello-like experience in the editor for managing todos.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick\">@_benmccormick</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtomEditor\">@AtomEditor</a> You might also like imdone-atom.

It’s similar to Syntastic for Vim and SublimeLinter for Sublime Text.  But Atom’s flexibility allows it to be better than both of those.  Like Syntastic and SublimeLinter, Linter integrates with many different linting providers to show errors and warnings that tools pick up on through static analysis in files.  But rather than being limited to the line-by-line gutter warnings or showing collections of warnings through awkward use of UI elements meant for a different purpose, Linter shows you a live collection of errors at the bottom of the file and lets you easily switch back and forth between that and errors for all open project files.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 97.26027397260275%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"linter\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png\" srcset=\"/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/40f08/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 143w,\n/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/d4502/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 285w,\n/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/a9e6e/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 570w,\n/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/c2e96/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 855w,\n/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/f4f98/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 1140w,\n/static/ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4/67935/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2.png 1606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n  </span>\n<h3>git-time-machine</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/littlebee/git-time-machine\">git-time-machine</a> is the newest package on this list.
