Because there was a decent amount of interest, I’m planning on fleshing out the idea a bit with a small series of posts on CS basics.  These posts will cover some concepts that would usually be covered in an intro level CS course.  If folks find them helpful I may move on to more advanced topics like Data Structures &#x26; Algorithms, the software abstractions that modern web development is built on top of, and other math/theory topics.</p>\n<p>With these posts I’m not trying to replicate a CS intro course and won’t cover everything.  I’m not trying to teach anyone how to program.  Instead I’m covering the ideas and details behind concepts that FE devs may have learned by doing but never been exposed to from an theory point of view.  I am not an academic, so the goal will be to keep a casual tone focused on the practical implications of theory to a Front End developer.  If I’m successful, these posts will give you a better set of mental models when working to understand the code you’re reading and writing every day.  That’s plenty of throat-clearing, so now I’m going to jump into one of the most fundamental building blocks of any programming language: variables.</p>\n<h3>What are Variables? (Not as obvious as it sounds)</h3>\n<p>Variables in programming languages are symbols that we assign to represent a value.  That seems simple enough, but that sentence is too vague to properly account for the complexity of reality.  When dealing with variables in the real world, it’s important to have a good mental model of how they really behave, or you may become confused by how your programs act.  For instance if you believe that variables are always live references to whatever other variable they were assigned to, you may be surprised by the behavior of this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\na <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// prints 1</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>and if you believe that variables always point to a unique value that is created when you assign to them, you might be surprised by this one:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\na<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// prints [1, 2, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Knowing generally that a variable points to a value is a great start.  But a proper understanding of the model that a programming language uses for variables can help you avoid subtle bugs.</p>\n<h3>How Variables Work</h3>\n<p>Here’s the most important sentence for gaining a proper understanding of how variables work: “A variable points to a location in memory.”  Explaining how memory is organized and allocated is outside the scope of this post, but for now it’s sufficient to just understand memory as a long list of blocks, each of which has it’s own address.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/13e99029e891d957a0e14cbc732767cc/925b5/memory1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

When a function is called, the argument variables are assigned to point at the memory address of the value passed into the function.</p>\n<h3>Mutable vs Immutable Variables</h3>\n<p>This memory address stuff can seem pretty abstract, and not very useful, but it’s a great gateway to understanding more practical topics.  A while back I wrote a post about <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2016/06/04/what-are-mutable-and-immutable-data-structures-2/\">mutable and immutable data</a>.  If you’re unfamiliar with the concepts you can read the original article for background.  But basically, JavaScript values are divided into 2 categories: primitives like booleans, strings, and numbers which are immutable, and objects which are mutable.  Immutable primitives can’t be changed, when they’re operated on they can only be replaced with a new value.  Mutable objects can be changed in place.  That “in place” qualifier can seem a bit hazy without understanding the underlying memory situation, but now we can explain this more clearly: the value for a primitive will never change within a memory location, a variable will instead have to point to a new location in memory.  A mutable variable can be modified without changing it’s location in memory.  This is the explanation behind our confusing example from earlier.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\na<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// prints [1, 2, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Because <code class=\"language-text\">b</code> points to the same location in memory as <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, when we mutate <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">b</code> continues to point to the same array as <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> and sees the same changes we performed on <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>.</p>\n<h3>Implications and Gotchas</h3>\n<p>There are a few practical implications of these concepts, and gotchas that folks with the wrong mental model around variables tend to run into.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><code class=\"language-text\">===</code> is based on location in memory for objects</strong> - While it does compare primitive values directly to see if they’re the same value, for objects, <code class=\"language-text\">===</code> compares by reference.

Both help with issues around variable scoping<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, but the difference between the two can seem rather confusing.  It seems like <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> might indicate a constant value that can’t be changed.  But mutable values declared with const can in fact change:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> arr <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\narr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// [1, 2, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Instead <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> is once again about memory and reference assignment.  A variable that is assigned through const can’t be reassigned to a new location in memory.  So if it is pointed to a primitive like <code class=\"language-text\">123</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">true</code>, it truly is a constant, because the value can’t change.

","layout":"post","path":"/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/","date":"2018/02/20","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I am primarily a front end web developer, and I have a Computer Science degree.  In my experience, this is neither rare nor particularly common.  Folks seem to get into front end dev because they’re trying to solve particular problems, and those problems exist whether you have a PhD in high performance computing or you’ve never written a line of code before.  Front end web development is how you make code real to people, and it is the minimal requirement for making something that people can actually interact with in a web browser.  As a result, a dizzying array of folks get into Front end dev, and you’ll find a broader set of experience levels than devs who work further “down the stack”.  All of which means that many front end devs have never had any sort of “formal” Computer Science education.</p>\n<p>Some CS degree holders turn up their nose at this, and it contributes to the reputation in some quarters of JavaScript and web dev not being “real programming”.  Some self-taught devs see themselves as being liberated from the “irrelevant theory” of formal Computer Science and see no need for that type of background for Front End development.  We all have the capacity to turn any sort of credential into a tribal mark.  My own experience is that developers can function just fine on the front end without a formal computer science background, but that my own education has helped me in my day to day work, mostly in subtle and indirect ways.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking for a while about what Computer Science topics are actually useful for front end developers.  It’s not obvious to me where to draw the lines, because you’ll never directly encounter many of the concepts that are covered in a typical Computer Science curriculum while making web applications. But I still have an intuition that my background in these subjects is helping me in my day to day.  This weekend I decided to ask Twitter about it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pondering what a blog series on “Computer Science for Front End Devs” would look like.  <br><br>Thinking this would be a high level of “what you missed if you don’t have a CS degree”, focusing on a subset relevant to FE devs.<br><br>Would love input.  What would you expect to be covered?</p>&mdash; Ben McCormick (@_benmccormick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick/status/965373638697463809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 18, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<p>I got a high degree of interest from that tweet, and so decided to keep digging into the idea.  I did some research into the typical structure of a modern Computer Science curriculum, and came up with the lists below. Depending on the school, certain topics may be elevated or diminished, grouped or split, but the general shape tends to look the same for most schools I’ve looked at.</p>\n<h3>Intro class</h3>\n<p>Generally there is an intro class or 2 that can be skipped by students with previous experience that covers core programming concepts, usually with an Object-oriented philosophical tilt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Programming basics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variables</li>\n<li>Basic Data Structures</li>\n<li>Control Structures/Recursion/Iteration</li>\n<li>Object Oriented Programming principles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Core Curriculum</h3>\n<p>There are also often 3-5 other “core” classes that all CS majors must take.  They generally break down something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big O analysis</li>\n<li>Common Data Structures - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues Trees, Heaps, Graphs, etc</li>\n<li>Common Algorithms - Searches, Sorts, Graph algorithms, etc</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Computer Systems</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start at the hardware level</li>\n<li>Assembly</li>\n<li>Compilers</li>\n<li>Memory Models</li>\n<li>Concurrency</li>\n<li>Operating Systems</li>\n<li>Processes</li>\n<li>File Systems</li>\n<li>Networking</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mathematical Foundations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proofs and logic</li>\n<li>Formal lanugages/Context Free Grammars/Turing Machines</li>\n<li>NP-Completeness</li>\n<li>Probability Theory</li>\n<li>Bayes Theorem</li>\n<li>Hashing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Software Engineering (not always core)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture of larger programs</li>\n<li>Balancing risk/quality/cost</li>\n<li>Design Patterns</li>\n<li>Designing for security/robustness/scalability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Potential Specialties</h3>\n<p>Finally, programs usually have a selection of electives that students can take to dive deeper into different specialty areas.  These electives usually mirror the research interests of the faculty of the school but may include some of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systems Design</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Computer Networking</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Databases</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Computer Science for the web</h2>\n<p>So how much of this is relevant to your average front end developer?  Some of it is more tightly tied to web programming than others.  Most of the basics will be picked up through osmosis for a typical front end dev, but a rigorous look at concepts like object-oriented programming and recursion might be beneficial.  While most can usually get by with simple data structures, a background in common “intermediate” data structures like stacks, trees, and graphs can be quite useful in day to day web dev.  Software Engineering principles are as obviously useful when building web sites as they are when you’re building firmware or operating systems. On the other hand, Computer Systems and Mathematical foundation concepts are usually not directly applicable in front end work.  In my own experience, they serve as useful background for understanding the abstractions that my day to day work is built on.  It’s good to have an intuition as to how browsers work, what is happening when we send data to a file, or what “text encoding” means.  And you may end up in a crazy situation where you need to understand the code behind Babel or V8, and knowledge of compilers becomes a real part of your job.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to figure out the best way to teach some of this stuff to somebody who hasn’t and is never going to spend 4 years taking these classes.  So I’d love help from anyone reading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If you have a CS degree and write front end code, how has it helped you?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you were going to try and share part of that education with somebody with different experiences, which parts would you say are important?  What resources would you recommend?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you don’t have a CS degree, do you feel like you’re missing out on anything?  What useful-seeming concepts have you heard about but found it hard to find resources on?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have any answers for those questions I’d love to hear from y’all on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"mailto:ben@benmccormick.org\">email</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["React","Computer Science"],"category":"opinion","key":"weekly-links-03-02-18","title":"Weekly Links: March 2nd","description":"The future of React, Makefiles, state machines and blindness","layout":"weekly-links","path":"/2018/03/02/weekly-links-03-02-18/","date":"2018/03/02","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\">Sneak Peek: Beyond React 16| React Blog</a> - This is a preview of where React is going next.  I’m still processing through this, and how I can use it, but Suspense seems like something that will make dealing with async data much easier in React.  Loading states are something I deal with all the time, and having cleaner primitives for expressing them will be a big win.</p>\n<h3>Programming Tools</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.olioapps.com/blog/the-lost-art-of-the-makefile/\">The Lost Art of the Makefile |Jesse Hallett</a> - An interesting case for using Makefiles to manage modern JavaScript builds on projects that don’t need the overhead of webpack.  I don’t think this is going to be the next trend in JS, but I am interested to see where the JS world leans next when it comes to task automation.  When I started using JS, I saw people using Make or tools from other language ecosystems to build projects.  Grunt and Gulp really changed that and moved folks towards using the node ecosystem for task automation.  Now the community seems to have settled on webpack for build related tasks, and npm scripts for everything else.  I’m all good with webpack for builds, it’s complicated but powerful.  But npm scripts are frustrating as a task automation solution.  There’s no ability to comment, and long operations in nested JSON strings are a bit unwieldy.  I’d love to see some standardization on something more like make that allows comments and powerful task composition.</p>\n<h3>Computer Science In JS</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://raganwald.com/2018/02/23/forde.html\">Forde’s Tenth Rule, or, “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and ❤️ the State Machine” | Reginald Braithwaite</a> - A really nice explanation of state machines, and how they can be used in JavaScript development.  The article is written at a very conceptual level and really explains the topic well.  I was thinking afterwards about how the state machine concepts reminded me of Redux, and fortunately I found another link that expanded on that connection…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-model-the-behavior-of-redux-apps-using-statecharts-5e342aad8f66\">How to model the behavior of Redux apps using statecharts | Luca Matteis</a> - I hadn’t heard of statecharts before reading this, but they look like a really interesting tool for talking about large systems.  I’d be really curious to play with the redux middleware for automatically generating them and see if the artifacts it produces are useful.</p>\n<h3>Non-Tech</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/opinion/eyesight-going-blind.html\">Am I Going Blind? | Frank Bruni</a> - This is absurdly well written, and it hit me personally since the idea of going blind has always been a personal fear of mine.  I think everybody has their one bad thing that they irrationally fear will happen to them and this is mine.  The article was good perspective in mutliple ways, reminding me how blessed I am and how resilient humans (and our bodies) are.

It aims to be a more minimalist take on expanding class capabilities (primarily adding private state syntax) than other proposals that have come along over the last few years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/wycats/b1c96c67074396a239abd60f55087adc\">thoughts.md | Yehuda Katz</a> - This was a response to the JS Classes 1.1 proposal from Yehuda Katz, the lead proponent of adding decorator syntax for JavaScript classes.

Worth diving into, especially if you like fun visuals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.nrwl.io/the-3-skills-that-helped-me-become-a-better-software-engineer-8b06a37becf3\">The 3 Skills That Helped Me Become a Better Software Engineer | Victor Savkin</a> - This is worth sharing solely for the advice about mental models.  In my experience the ability to think in abstractions (and understand when you need to dig deeper) is one of the biggest hurdles in programming when trying to grow from a beginner to a more advanced software engineer.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<p>I’ve been working through a goal to read 30 books in a year, and have worked through a few more books recently.  Here are two good ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Gbh9R2\">The Martian | Andy Weir</a> - Yes I know I’m 3 years late on this one.  But I’m sure there are other lost souls like me who entered 2018 without reading this book.  If you love tech and science (and I’m guessing you do if you’re reading this), you should find a way to read The Martian.  My first thought when I started reading it was “This is great”.  My second thought was “How in the world did this end up becoming a Hollywood Blockbuster starring Matt Damon?“.  The Martian is unapologetically geeky, and it is “real science” fiction, with a very human core. I loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G1h9ah\">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a> - This was a recommendation from my manager, and is a great read for anyone who wants to improve the meetings they’re in at work.  It’s written in a “business fable” style, with a story serving to illustrate the principles it is trying to teach.  One thing I love is that it tells the story of the principles being implemented from a lower rung employee, rather than a top-down executive driven approach, so hopefully it can be inspirational to you even if you feel like you wouldn’t be able to change your meeting culture even if you knew what to do.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/03/24/weekly-links-03-11-24/"}}}],"topic":"Computer Science"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
