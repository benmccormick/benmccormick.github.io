In other words, when I open a browser and enter a url then hit enter, and a website shows up on my screen what can you tell me about what is happening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usually I get one of a few responses:</p>\n<h4>1. The clueless shrug</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uh….  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have no idea what to do with the question.  Things get awkward. This is mostly for junior positions but still isn’t the best sign.  Sometimes a few prods will get things back on track.</p>\n<h4>2. The bare minimum</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is asking a server for the site and the server sends you the site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people can give a very basic response, but don’t give a lot of details.  This again mostly corresponds to less experienced devs and can be fine as a starting spot with some follow-up questions.</p>\n<h4>3. The CliffNotes</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your browser sends an HTTP request which gets routed through a local modem/router and gets sent to a name server for its url extension.  That name server routes the request to the correct IP address, which will resolve to some sort of web server.  That server will serve up either some static files, or run some backend code in order to generate a resource (probably an html page).  When the HTML page is returned, your browser will parse it, which will likely generate more requests, and the cycle will repeat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people know how some of this works, maybe with a few hazy areas and can explain it in a reasonably straightforward way.  An explanation like this is a great start.</p>\n<h4>4. The Geek-out</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><Some variation on the previous answer... followed by:> Let me tell you all about my in depth knowledge of &#x3C;HTTP<em>network routing</em>JavaScript parsing/TCP/other related topic></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people dive in and explode with information.</p>\n<h3>So why is this a good interview question again?</h3>\n<p>So which answer is best?  The geek-out right?  Well… its great when somebody gets there, but in my mind this question is more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to make the case that this is a pretty bad interview question.  It’s not clear what the expected answer is.  When I ask it in junior dev interviews, they often don’t have much of a clue how to answer it.  And it’s not strictly answerable in full detail by pretty much anyone.  But I’d argue that those things actually end up being strengths.  I like this question for 5 reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the candidate’s ability to deal with ambiguity.</strong>  The question is intentionally vague and open ended.  Am I just looking for a perfunctory response like “it gets a resource from a server”?  Do I want a deep dive into how DNS works?  It’s ambiguous.  Candidates can respond to that ambiguity in one of a few ways.</p>\n<p>They can freeze because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>They can ask a clarifying question.</p>\n<p>They can make a guess at what I want and start going down that road, while reading my reaction to see if they’re still on track.</p>\n<p>Or they can decide they know what I want (or what they want to tell me) and shoot off like a rocket (potentially for a very long time).</p>\n<p>This is super useful information in an interview because developers deal with ambiguity all the time.  When a candidate encounters unclear requirements from a product manager, or unclear documentation from another developer, it’s good to have an idea how they’ll respond<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the breadth of a candidates knowledge.</strong> - For the most part, when I interview people, I ask them questions about the role they’re applying for:  Front-End Dev, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, etc.  But this question gives a candidate the chance to show that they understand what’s happening up and down the web stack from the code they interact with the most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate a chance to explain a complex technical topic.</strong> - In my mind, good communication ability is the most important skill for a developer once they’ve achieved a minimum level of technical competence.  Being able to talk about problems and solutions clearly and explain them to a variety of audiences matters, and it matters a lot.  Can the candidate summarize a complex technical topic without getting bogged down in details?  Are they communicating with me (verbally or otherwise) to make sure I’m following their explanation?  Or are they fading off into a rambling run-on explanation of a trivial detail without any big picture context?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It forces the candidate to confront something they don’t know.</strong> - The internet is a perfect example of the Isaac Newton quote about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants\">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>.  It is the culmination of 50+ years of research and work on networked computer systems.  No candidate I interview for a web development position is going to understand every detail of how it works, because you can always go a layer deeper in the stack or afield into crazier edge case behavior.  So at some point in questioning (possibly very early), this question exhausts every candidate’s knowledge.  The question is how do they react?  Some candidates start guessing at things.  Some admit they don’t know.  Some try to skirt around areas they don’t feel confident in and work at avoiding any questions where they would have to admit they don’t know something.  And some will actually ask me how part of the system works.  This again is helpful because “not knowing the answer” is such a common experience in real world web dev.  It’s great to have some clues to how a candidate handles that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate an opportunity to show off what they know.</strong>  I’ve gotten some amazing answers to this question.  It turns out some candidates actually know a lot about networking and HTTP/TCP/nameservers.  Some can give detailed answers about browsers and how they parse resources and display the DOM.  Maybe they just know a lot of random trivia about URLs and DNS.  Regardless, this is a chance to show off and prove that they’ve delved deep into something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think every interview question should be like this one.  Most should probably directly relate to the work the candidate is doing, be clearly comparable in an objective way candidate to candidate, and not risk sending the interview down a 10 minute rabbit hole.  But this one is my favorite, and I think there’s a place for questions that show how a candidate might handle some real world lack of structure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick\">@_benmccormick</a> to tell me your favorite interview question.

But it’s important to be aware of the other styles/approaches available in your leadership toolbox. A strong leader understands that different styles can be valuable when an environment or situation calls for it. As Herminia Ibarra says in my <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\">favorite article</a> on this subject, “Small changes—in the way we carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact—often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup/\">Taste The Soup | Rands</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a meeting where an individual or team is presenting a complex idea or project, my job as the leader is soup tasting. It’s sampling critical parts of the idea to get a sense of how this soup has been or will be made. Who are the critical people? What are the critical parts? Which decisions matter? I don’t know. I do believe that a pre-requisite for leadership is that you have experience. You’ve had trials which have resulted in both impressive successes and majestic failures. These aggregate lessons define your metaphoric soup tasting ability, and when your team brings you a topic to review, it is this experience you apply to ask the critical soup questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/\">Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder | Charity Majors</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you like engineering management, your tendency is to go “cool, now I’m a manager”, and move from job to job as an engineering manager, managing team after team of engineers.  But this is a trap.  It is not a sound long term plan.  It leads too many people off to a place they never wanted to end up: technically sidelined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lethain.com/values-oasis/\">Trapped in a Values Oasis | Will Larson</a>  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>  The rule of thumb here is to lead through ambiguity, and advocate through disagreement.\nIt’s important to diagnose your situation correctly, because when you get it wrong, it’ll still feel like you’re making progress, but it’s wholly dependent on you and it’s progress that is likely to come at the cost of undermining both you and your team within the broader organization. It can be extraordinarily frustrating to “disagree and commit” to a policy or value that goes against your personal values, but any worthwhile measure of successful leadership needs to consider your team’s success more highly than your own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://kellanem.com/notes/friday-wins\">Friday Wins &#x26; A Case Study in Ritual Design | Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Culture is what you celebrate.

You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. You don’t want that person or the rest of the team to think you’re a jerk.

Without much work, it’s easy to find <em>Senior Engineers</em> with 2 years of professional experience, <em>junior developer</em> job descriptions requesting 5 years of experience, <em>tech lead</em> roles focused purely on technology, <em>tech lead</em> roles where the lead is managing a team, and who can tell the difference between a <em>CTO</em> and a <em>VP of Engineering</em> anyway?  This results in weird title shifts when developers switch jobs, odd or unfair salary distributions, and a world where it is very difficult to understand what a career path looks like in this industry.</p>\n<p>Camille Fournier’s book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p\">The Manager’s Path</a> steps into this breach by laying out a clear look at an engineering management-focused career path. The book runs through a series of roles: <em>Mentor</em> to <em>Tech Lead</em> to <em>Manager</em> to <em>Manager of Managers</em> all the way up to <em>Executive</em>. For each role she describes what the job is,  walks through what type of challenges you might face in the role after a promotion, and offers practical advice on overcoming those challenges.</p>\n<p>I found it to be an extremely engaging read, and the best description of what it actually looks like to advance in technical leadership roles I’ve ever read.  Because she focuses on skills and responsibilities more than titles, it’s possible to apply her advice across large and small companies, even those with wonky title structures.  It helped me think about what skills I need to be building in my career, and gave me a glimpse of what next steps look like.</p>\n<p>The focus on common challenges and how to face them was also helpful, though whole books could (and have) been written on those challenges and how to face them at each level.  The Manager’s Path serves as a good starting point here, identifying the challenges and giving good solid general advice for facing them.  For those new to a role it could help them identify where they’re weak or uncomfortable, and serve as a starting point to a deeper dive into those areas.</p>\n<p>As I read the book, I immediately thought of 4 or 5 people at various points in their career I knew who could benefit greatly from reading this book.  If you’re working in the software world and think that you long term are interested in advancing in your career beyond your current role, there will probably be interesting tidbits in here for you.  Even those who are sure they <strong>don’t</strong> want to be in management could benefit from understanding the perspectives of what engineering managers actually <em>do</em>.  The book is also structured so that the first few chapters are highly relevant for both technical and manager track developers; tech lead is an important role on both tracks.  If you fall into one of those buckets, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p\">The Manager’s Path</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/06/12/book-review-the-managers-path"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"utility-functions,reusable-react,book-review-five-dysfunctions","topics":["management","leadership"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"consistency","title":"Consistency","description":"How do we encourage standards in a code base without losing perspective?","layout":"post","path":"/2019/04/01/consistency","date":"2019/04/01","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>The last few weeks I’ve had several conversations with a coworker about consistency in code: why do we do things one way here, and a different way there?  Some of this is macro level; Where do we split chunks of related functionality into different files?  Some of it is micro level; what should the rules be for when we use an inline function instead of pulling it out into its own named method?  Some of it is trivial; Do we use <code class=\"language-text\">_</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> to separate words in file names?  In our current codebase we’re not always consistent on many of these issues.  As we’ve discussed the various issues, I realized that some of them bothered me more than others, and (more interestingly to me) my ideas have changed here over time.</p>\n<h3>The Platonic Ideal</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p> In a perfectly consistent system, 3 developers writing the same module would produce line by line identical code</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s an extreme point of view out there that says “while a perfectly consistent system might not be possible, the closer we can get to that the better”.  The benefits of consistency are many: consistent naming helps with code search and connecting different parts of a system.  Consistent code structure makes code easier to scan once a developer is familiar with the system, and it makes exceptions stand out as something intentional and interesting.  Consistent formatting removes potential distractions.   So what’s not to love?  Shouldn’t we always try to add more consistency?  I see 2 primary reasons why it might not be worth trying to enforce every single rule we can come up with.</p>\n<h4>We’re only human</h4>\n<p>The first reason not to enforce “everything” is that our human attention spans can only internalize so many rules at once.  When we’re trying to remember a large number of rules, its easy to miss one.  But more importantly, when we’re writing code or reviewing it, focusing too much on human enforced consistency rules can distract from the actual purpose of the code, making it harder to notice the substance of code because we’re so focused on the form.</p>\n<h4>Standards too soon</h4>\n<p>The other thing that can happen when you try to standardize everything is a loss of creativity.  Sometimes it’s helpful to experiment for a while to find the right pattern in a codebase.  In an ideal situation experiments like that will happen on the side, or be explored in branches, but for small teams or new codebases, it will likely happen at least partially in production.</p>\n<h3>User Friendly Consistency</h3>\n<p>So what <strong>can</strong> we do to get the benefits of consistency? The 4 ways I like to see this happen are:</p>\n<h4>Automation</h4>\n<p>The best way to enforce stylistic consistency and other straightforward things like naming conventions is to use automation.  Linters like <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> and auto-formatters like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>.  My rule here is that any linter rule that is about stylistic consistency should be auto-fixable, if not it isn’t clear enough or isn’t worth it.  For “correctness rules” it can be ok to flag errors without auto-fixing, if human judgement is needed.</p>\n<h4>Code Review Checklists</h4>\n<p>Code reviews can be a good way to limitedly enforce consistency; but its good to limit scope to avoid <a href=\"https://samsaccone.com/posts/code-reviews-not-nits.html\">developers trying to become human compilers</a>.  If you try to enforce too many things in code reviews, its easy for people to get caught up in going through a list and forget to apply human judgement to the context of the current code. But <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews\">code review checklists</a> are a good way to make a coordinated push on high value items that are either new or often neglected.  This checklist should consist of a few important things to check during every review. The list should be re-examined on a regular basis and ideally kept to 5 or less items.</p>\n<h4>Focused Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Sometimes its appropriate to have “refactoring initiatives” to standardize on a particular pattern over time.  This can be good for standardizing on a particular library for a task, or removing an older pattern that persists in the codebase after a better way has been found.  My advice here is to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/\">only do one of these at a time, and complete them before starting a new one</a>.  One of the biggest causes of inconsistency is when a team attempts to ”<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">standardize</a>” on a solution, then abandons that for a new solution without finish the migration, resulting in a <a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html\">lava layer architecture</a>.</p>\n<h4>Focus on the high level</h4>\n<p>If there is one place to apply human consistency checks its at the structural level.  If your high level patterns are consistent, the code base will be easy to navigate, and modular code written in a standardized high level structure will be <a href=\"https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to\">easy to delete</a>.  Overall low level code that is inconsistent or poorly written is easier to overcome than high level code as long as you’re taking advantage of code reviews and the other methods suggested here to improve new code, because most low level code is only read occasionally.  So high traffic “messy code” can be a focus of refactoring efforts, and the rest can continue working without disturbing anything.</p>\n<p>Messy code is much more problematic at a structural level though, because when different areas of the code are arranged in different ways, it becomes much harder to find functionality when debugging.  This type of inconsistency also tends to make bulk improvements harder, as you have to have a much greater understanding of all the ways a codebase is put together.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/01/consistency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"manager-and-developer,herding-lions,soft-skills","topics":["leadership","management"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"managing-distributed-team","title":"Lessons From Managing A Distributed Team","description":"What to do when you can't just walk to your employee's desk.","layout":"post","path":"/2019/06/24/managing-a-distributed-team","date":"2019/06/17","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Working with people over the internet is different from meeting in an office five days a week.  This isn’t a moral statement.  I’ve done and enjoyed both.  Working with a distributed team requires a different set of skills, especially when you’re a leader.  Today I want to share the most helpful lessons I’ve learned over the last year managing a distributed team.</p>\n<h4>Evaluate process and outcomes, not inputs</h4>\n<p>Focusing on output` is great advice for any team, but it’s easier and more important when managing remote teams.  When you’re not in the office with people, you won’t see when they start in the morning or finish at night.  You won’t be able to tell if they’re taking long coffee breaks or checking Amazon between tasks.  You’ll have to evaluate them on their output and on the methods they use to get work done.</p>\n<p>Evaluating on outputs is tricky for tech work in the short term.  It’s often hard to tell how hard a specific task should have been.  But over the long run, you’ll need to find ways to see if developers are meeting their goals, and focus on that over the exact times they did work.  And this is good, because that is actually what matters.</p>\n<p>Output is a lagging indicator though.  In the short term, what you can evaluate if “butts in seats” isn’t an option.  I recommend process: is work being documented, are tests being written and are code reviews being done in a timely manner?  The nice thing about this is that you can check these things in low touch ways; by reviewing your issue tracking and version control systems rather than having status meetings or sending distracting slack messages.  This idea comes up in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XBg1iv\">Camille Fournier’s book The Manager’s Path</a>, where she argues persuasively for always doing your information gathering in ways that don’t disrupt your team first.</p>\n<h4>1-1s are extra important</h4>\n<p>Let’s say Sarah has some lingering concerns about her current project that she’s not yet ready to raise to the full group.  When I work in the same office with Sarah, she can drop by my desk anytime to talk through a small issue.  When we’re working remotely, that may not feel as comfortable for a variety of reasons.  Good 1-1s provide space for the little things to come out.</p>\n<h4>When you get in-person time, focus on the relationship</h4>\n<p>Currently I get together with my team (and my manager) about once a quarter.  Initially my instinct was to save the “big work stuff” for that time.  And I still try to get a few big conversations in each time, mostly around career development.  But the most value from these visits has come in the gaps, when I go out to lunch with my team and chat, or we get together with a larger group after work.  Time spent together builds trust, and that trust lingers and pays off when you’re back on the other side of the internet the next week.</p>\n<h4>Async communication is great.  Don’t neglect “face to face” time.</h4>\n<p>“Embrace async communication” is common remote work advice.  When you get stuff done through email/slack/Github/Invision/etc you have fewer meetings and more flow time for your team.  Which is great!  My team takes advantage of “async” tools every day.  But I also try to be intentional about working in “face to face” time through Zoom.  For my team that’s a daily standup and weekly 1-1s, but it could be different for another team’s process.  The key is to not <em>only</em> rely on writing.  Writing is an amazing way to communicate, but it will always lack the context of the human face.

If Jerry tends to miss all nuance when you communicate in text, try to spend more time talking over zoom to make sure you’re communicating.  On the other hand if Jennifer has a tendency to lose track of what you’re asking her to do, you may want to give instructions through a text medium, where you can use it for accountability later.</p>\n<h4>Hire for remote success</h4>\n<p>Not everyone is going to thrive in a remote role.  Most companies hiring remote recognize this and try to filter for it in some form. A lot of companies’ response here is to “only hire senior”.  Which is probably a workable heuristic in some ways.  Developers that have a proven track record of success probably have built up some habits that will help them succeed in remote work even if they aren’t naturally inclined to it.  But hiring only senior folks is expensive, and makes things like diversity and career growth paths harder.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done this enough to draw any hard conclusions on remote hiring yet.  But the qualities I want to evaluate for are independence, technological comfort, writing skills, and a history of taking the initiative to seize opportunities (in whatever domain).  Obviously that’s in addition to normal hiring criteria.</p>\n<h4>Tools and Process matter</h4>\n<p>The worst way to work remote is to not commit to it.  Commitment means aligning your process toward remote work.  Some lessons here.</p>\n<p><strong>First, Hybrid meetings are harmful to your team</strong>.  There are 3 ways to do meetings: in person, remote, or hybrid.  An in person meeting involves putting a number of humans in a small room for an hour and letting them talk through an issue.  A remote meeting connects various people from the comforts of whatever work venue they’ve chosen, and discussion ensues over the internet.  In a hybrid meeting, some people are in the room, and some are connecting remotely.  Hybrid meetings are hell for the remote folks.  Usually they can’t hear at least one person well.  They can’t match faces to voices, lose context of what is happening in the room, and are sometimes just plain ignored by the folks in the room.</p>\n<p>I really didn’t understand how bad this was until I did it myself a few times.  If you’re a leader who uses or tolerates hybrid meetings, I highly recommend trying to call into them remotely a few times.  As the boss you’ll get a slightly different experience, but ask yourself: are you a first class meeting participant when you’re calling in remote?  If not, is it acceptable to you to treat your remote workers as second class participants?</p>\n<p><strong>Second, Use good tools</strong>.  Bad collaboration software is a drag if you’re working with people in person.  It’s a killer for remote teams.  Use software that lets you communicate in timely and useful ways, keep your project critical information organized, and lets your team focus on getting stuff done.  There are hundreds of good tools out there these days, so there’s no excuse for using bad ones.  My recommendations, which are not particularly controversial and also not the only good options: use Zoom for video chat, Slack for messaging, Bitbucket, GitHub, or Gitlab for Version Control, Trello or Jira<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> for task tracking depending on the size of your team, and Google Drive for keeping documents and documentation together<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I… don’t love Jira.

It’s been an interesting experience, and because this is a fairly common way to transition into engineering management<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, I thought it might be worthwhile to share some lessons I’ve learned so far.</p>\n<h4>1. Time discipline is key</h4>\n<p>The biggest challenge of this transition was learning to be a manager.  It’s a whole new job!  But the biggest challenge specific to the management/developer split has been managing my time.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit loose with my time management.  I do a lot based on my mental state at a particular time; if I’m tired or uninspired I may lean more into grunt work like documentation, code reviews, or more “scripted” code work.  If I’m in the zone I’ll dive into big tasks, and if someone comes to me with a problem I tend to context shift into it and go from there.</p>\n<p>This “time management strategy” hasn’t held up at all while trying to balance manager and development strategies.  Basically because of the blend of <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">maker and manager schedules</a>.  Developers need long uninterrupted periods of time to be productive, while managers tend to operate on a much more social and interrupt driven schedule.  They’re naturally opposed.</p>\n<p>Working with this tension requires discipline and planning.  For me personally I’ve started planning my schedule for the next day at the end of the previous day, batching my checking of Slack/email and being more thoughtful when somebody asks for my time.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning my schedule for the next day</strong> is a tip I picked up from <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work</a>.  To close out the day, I review the things I’ll need to handle the next day, and block out my calendar with time for different tasks for the next day.  This does mean that my calendar <em>always looks completely booked for the current day</em>.  So far this has served as a feature not a bug; I can still move things if something urgent comes up and it has a way of encouraging people to schedule less urgent things in advance.  Note that scheduling like this doesn’t mean you can’t change plans; I do all the time.  It just means that you start with a plan and can be thoughtful about how you vary off of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Batching Slack and email</strong> has been something I’ve known would be good for me forever.  It feels good in the moment to be the guy who is constantly available, but the cost of distraction is higher than you think.  So far, management has been a catalyst for me buckling down here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I get a lot more unexpected requests for my time now than I did previously.  I’ve found that batching my email and Slack reading combined with <strong>a willingness to suggest a meeting later in the day or the next morning rather than <em>right now</em></strong> has helped me protect blocks of productivity and focus, without making me an unresponsive manager.  Most things can sit for 2 hours without blowing up anyone’s day.  The key is to ask enough to identify the 5% of things that can’t wait.</p>\n<p>Those 3 tactics have worked for me, but overall it comes down to being intentional about your time.  If you let yourself be blown by the wind while splitting dual responsibilities, one of them will almost always receive the short end of the stick.</p>\n<h4>2. Team success metrics are the only ones that matter</h4>\n<p>When you’re acting as both a developer and a manager, it can be tempting to hold yourselves to 2 sets of metrics: management metrics and development metrics.  This is a mistake.  It will cause you to over-prioritize your own tasks and hurt your team’s long term growth.</p>\n<p>Focusing on personal development metrics and goals can lead to over-prioritizing them for a few reasons. First, development goals tend to be much “cleaner” than management goals; it’s easier to tell what you’ve achieved.  Second, if you’re transitioning into this role from a dev role, you probably are much more comfortable with these tasks, and so they can act as a safe place where you avoid having to stretch yourself.  And finally, if you moved into this role from a senior dev position, it can be easy to tell yourself that this is actually the best way to get stuff done.  And you may be right… in the short term.</p>\n<p>So what’s the antidote?  Focus on team productivity and view your own work as just an extra card you have to play in your hand.  It’s an advantage you have over less technical managers, but if you don’t set to working developing other strengths, you’re not going to be able to grow, and if you’re monopolizing the important work your team won’t be able to step up into new roles.  So play that card, but do it with caution, and always as a means rather than an end.</p>\n<h4>3. This isn’t long term sustainable; have a plan</h4>\n<p>Hybrid Management / Developer roles aren’t a long term game.  Aside from the scheduling tension I mentioned above, once you move into this role you’re either going to be slowly giving up responsibilities and watching your tech skills slowly move off the cutting edge as you focus on learning how to manager your team and developing others to fill the roles you once did, or you’re going to be failing as a manager as you try to cling too tightly to your senior individual contributor responsibilities.  So if you want to avoid that, it’s important to be evaluating how you want your career to evolve.  A role like this can be a first step up a chain, or part of a <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">dev to manager pendulum</a>.  You also might discover that management isn’t for you and decide to move back.  I’m committed to this for a set period of time, and that’s helped me to work through the days when I wonder what I actually accomplished, and think strategically about what I need to get better at.</p>\n<h4>4. Best Management resources</h4>\n<p>So this isn’t a learning so much, but as a newbie manager, probably the best thing I can do is point you to the resources I’ve found helpful.

When I first went through this sheet, I circled over 40 words as values that “resonated” with me.  They’re things that I value and strive for, or wish that I was more like.  Deciding between adventurousness and cowardice is not a “values decision”. A real values decision means that you’re trying to decide whether good traits like adventurousness, belonging, or clear-mindedness are more important to you.</p>\n<p>Management often forces you to choose between goods: Will we ship quicker? Aim for higher quality? How do those choices impact work/life balance for our teams?. It’s hard to know if we’re making good choices, because the results routinely lack clarity.  Indicators lag, causation is fuzzy, and we don’t get to compare to a control group.  Values can be guideposts through ambiguity.  I’ve seen the power of this at a company level in my current gig, where having a set of values that are kept in the spotlight often allows us to weaponize them as decision making tools <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Going through the list, I eventually cut things down to 20, 12, 10 and then 8.
