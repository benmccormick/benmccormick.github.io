Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.  Behind door number #1 lies a relatively rapid path to a “senior developer” role, followed by stagnation the rest of your career as you reimplement the same solutions in new technologies for minimally increasing pay over time, until youth-friendly tech culture decides that you’re too old to be useful.  Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 145.51495016611295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/40f08/twtl.png 143w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/d4502/twtl.png 285w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["productivity","career"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"staying-productive","title":"Staying Productive","description":"Thinking through the environmental factors that lead to productivity","layout":"post","path":"/2016/01/25/staying-productive","date":"2016-01-25T04:41:46+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what makes me productive vs unproductive.  A lot of the time Software Developers tend to focus on their tools and environments when they think about productivity.  I’m certainly all into that, as you can see if you look <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">back</a>, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2015/11/25/productive-javascript-development/\">through</a>, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2016/01/11/the-most-interesting-atom-packages-ive-found-so-far/\">my blog</a>.  But in my mind the most important factors in building productivity are non-software related.</p>\n<h3>Setting Goals</h3>\n<p>By far the most important thing I’ve found for being productive was setting clear goals for what I want to get done.  Without goal posts to aim for, it’s hard to tell what you’ve really accomplished, and easy to get pulled off onto suboptimal tasks.  Goals are best set with a wider context in mind.  The act of setting and measuring goals tends to make us focus on those areas, so make sure your goals reflect your priorities.  If you set all of your goals around work, it can be easier to justify neglecting your family.  If you set a goal of writing every day, that might overwhelm time for exercising and keeping yourself healthy.  Therefore its helpful to set goals in a holistic way that allows you to judge what you value in the big picture.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical / Creative Tasks</h3>\n<p>I saw a great <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10959022\">comment</a> on Hacker News the other day that differentiated between projects and chores. The idea is that when you’re feeling productive you should work on projects, when you’re not you should do chores.  One of the biggest boosts to my productivity I’ve found was when I started categorizing work in my head as “mechanical” vs “creative” tasks.  Mechanical tasks (ie chores) are things that require little mental energy.  They’re well defined and possibly onerous.  Examples include filing email, documenting code, code reviews, and low-thinking code tasks like reproducing a client issue or adding a small well-defined feature.  Creative tasks for me tend to look like more involved code changes designing new features, or debugging client issues that aren’t obvious.</p>\n<p>I’m not universally energetic or productive.  Some days I can focus intently on a problem, other days I have the attention span of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSUXXzN26zg\">the dogs from UP!</a>.  When I’m able to focus, I intentionally put aside mechanical tasks, and leave them for times when I have less energy, continuous time or attention.  Oftentimes I’ll even put off higher priority mechanical tasks (or vice versa) to match my mental level to the task, because I end up getting more done sooner in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Productive Environments are a thing</h3>\n<p>It’s easy to think of productivity as a purely internal thing.  But the environment you’re in matters too.  For creative software work that means getting large blocks of non-distracting time.  That requires some intentionality.  I’ve been blessed with a workplace where I’m given plenty of flexibility.  That means that at times of high distraction-level (big projects, lots of meetings) I tend to actually do most of my work outside of the office, sometimes at weird times.  I use my time at the office for mechanical tasks and meetings, and do the creative work elsewhere.  That’s obviously suboptimal, and when I can I try to clear time during days to do creative work at the office and bunch the distractions.  However it works out for you, the key is to (as much as possible) group your distractions and leave large un-interrupted periods for creative work.</p>\n<p>Distractions can be self-inflicted as well as coming from others.  When I want to get stuff done, I try to listen to familiar music (oftentimes looping a single album for a few days).  I’ll also close Slack/Twitter/Email and other distracting apps.  Note that the distinction between mechanical and creative is important here.  When doing mechanical work, I’m fine having distractions around.  It’s only when I’m trying to harness mental energy that I care.</p>\n<h3>Day to Day work adds up</h3>\n<p>I’m a <a href=\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/\">magpie</a>.  I love shiny new tools, projects, and ideas.  It’s very easy for me to get bored with a problem once I feel like I understand it.   I get excited by pouring effort into learning something new, not so much the hard work to finish the last 20% of what I’ve started.  What I’m slowly learning though is that it is my day-to-day work that makes an impact, not my crazy productivity binges.  Making things that last requires day to day dedication.  That also means maintaining focus.  The easiest way to waste day to day hard work is to spend it on a different thing each day.  There’s nothing wrong with trying new things.  But real productivity requires setting some priorities and sticking with them for a while.</p>\n<h3>Team matters more than the project</h3>\n<p>Finally, individual productivity doesn’t happen in a vacuum.  Who we work with can undermine or boost our results.  I don’t believe that it’s a small difference either.  I’d rather have a great team with no individually brilliant members than a bad team with one or two great programmers any day.  One of <a href=\"http://www.windsorcircle.com/about-us/our-values\">Windsor Circle’s values</a> is that teams survive longer than individuals.  The same can be said of their results.  Teams can magnify what is possible for a product.  Any individual has limits on what he or she can create.  Teams allow for those limits to be lifted by building on each others skills. At the same time, teams can limit each other by fighting, mis-communicating, distracting, or pursuing different goals.  So all of the other productivities ideas here can be applied just as well to a team as they do to an individual.  The best work comes from teams consistently working together towards a common goal over a long period of time in a constant and productive environment.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2016/01/25/staying-productive"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"soft-skills,fe-concerns,react-confessions","topics":["leadership","career"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"obvious-things","title":"Obvious Things","description":"Obvious things that I still end up learning over and over again","layout":"post","path":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things","date":"2019/05/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I saw a tweet thread a few weeks ago that made me think:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There’s a bit of a meme in some parts that there is value in saying, out loud, “I realize that I am surprised.” For similar reasons, I often subvocalize “I believe I now understand the type of situation the ‘trivial’ advice was preparing me for.” <a href=\"https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH\">https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH</a></p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115751939210223616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And then you repeat it to someone and they say “lol that is obvious” and you wonder if you know the advice well enough yet to correct them on how not obvious it is going to be for their next 10 years.</p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115752453910061056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>I realized that I’ve encountered plenty of pieces of wisdom in my software career that have this property; I see them as clear and obvious when put in the abstract, but only learn to actually apply them by repeatedly failing to do so.  This is what people talk about when they say something is “hard earned experience” I guess.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples from my career:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>In the long run, rate of improvement (or regression) matters more than current level</strong> - This has applications in hiring, code quality, and finding/staying in a job.  But it’s often easier to observe how good something is now than to see how its changing, and I often fail to properly estimate what a trend means for a situation 1-3 years down the road.  It’s also easy to mis-apply this principle when you for get about the “long run” part.  A new employee with tons of potential won’t help you when you need an experienced hand <em>now</em> and fixing technical debt can easily cost you your ability to hit a quarterly objective.  Knowing how to balance these long and short term goals is something I still struggle with all the time.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewriting from scratch is (almost) never worth it</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/\">Joel Spoelsky</a> wrote about this way back in 2000 and I remember reading that article nearly a decade ago and nodding along.  I seem to have infinite capacity to convince myself that my current situation fits in those parentheses though.  In my career this has mostly been a problem where I’m able to more accurately forecast the pain that would ensue from fixing what exists (because that code exists and is easier to work with), while I appear to systematically underestimate the pain of building the new thing (because the internet told me it would be great, and the code doesn’t exist for me to nitpick yet).</li>\n<li><strong>Always consider multiple options</strong> - Pretty much any decision (technical or otherwise) benefits from having multiple contenders.  This seems obvious.  But I have often let myself fall into situations where I’m choosing between just 2 options, or really just choosing whether or not to do 1 thing.  This has applications in technology choices, job choices, responding to another person’s provocations, and more.  I intuitively know that more options are good, and I constantly miss opportunities to add options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how do we improve on these situations where we fail to apply <em>obvious</em> wisdom?  I’ve been learning a few things lately.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Always review what you’ve done on a regular basis</strong> - Do weekly reviews about how your week went.  Do quarterly reviews with yourself about how your job is going.  When you make big decisions, make sure to find a time to check back in later and evaluate how it went.  We make better decisions when we take the time to measure our results</li>\n<li><strong>Note Missed Opportunities</strong> - When you do those reviews, make sure to pay attention to when you missed an opportunity to apply something you <em>knew</em>.  Sometimes we make mistakes because we just didn’t know something.  It’s more common though that we didn’t properly apply our own principles and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify Cues</strong> - Identify the thing that you know you’re going to have to handle different next time.  Maybe you say “if I’m looking for a job, I should consider at least 4 or 5 different companies and not focus in on just one”, or if I’m asked to fix a legacy codebase, I will spend at least 3 months trying to improve it before considering a re-write,and I’ll look for real world comparisons to base a rewrite estimate on”.  Whatever it is for you, when you can identify situations where a specific action should take place, it can help you be better the next time instead of repeating the same old mistakes.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"adequate-talk,fe-concerns,favorite-interview","topics":["career","leadership","productivity"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"importance-of-writing","title":"The Importance of Writing For Software Developers","description":"Why your ability to write will shape your career","layout":"post","path":"/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing","date":"2019/03/02","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities</p>\n<p>- <em>Me, Christmas 2018</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think I caught my sister in law by surprise a bit when I answered her questions about the importance of writing in my job that way.  She’s an assistant professor who teaches writing to college students, and has found that her students pursuing technical degrees generally fail to see the value in learning to write.  The contrast between their expectations and my perspective after a decade working in software was strong.  I promised her at the time that I’d write down some thoughts on why writing skills are valuable for software engineers.  So here it is, 6 reasons that writing skills are crucial for working in the tech industry<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h4>1. You will write every day</h4>\n<p>Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside.  One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.  Here are a few types of writing that I’ve done daily or weekly for the last decade:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussing technical implementations through chat apps like slack</li>\n<li>Writing Bug Reports</li>\n<li>Writing comments in my code and technical documentation to help others and my future self understand what was done</li>\n<li>Writing reviews of other developers code to help our team improve and coordinate on best practices</li>\n<li>Answering questions from less technical employees or clients, often through email or slack.</li>\n<li>Creating design documents for complex work during planning times</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That list is illustrative but not exhaustive.  Any software engineer who wishes to build software that is used by others will end up doing plenty of writing.</p>\n<h4>2. The ability to explain complex topics will set you apart</h4>\n<p>The ability to take a complex topic and explain it in terms that somebody who doesn’t have all the background you do can understand is a critical one for software engineers.  This can help negate two of the most frustrating experiences for a developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A business asking for work that doesn’t make sense because the business folks don’t understand how the product works</li>\n<li>Less experienced members of the the team routinely making mistakes and breaking things because they don’t understand how the product works</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Senior engineers who can explain and document complex pieces of software save everyone frustration by helping junior members of the team understand how things work and be more productive, and by aligning business expectations and plans to the reality of how their software systems actually work.  These are hugely valuable activities that can make a big difference in your career.</p>\n<h4>3. Writing will help you find a (better) job</h4>\n<p>When I’ve interviewed software engineers, I see a variety of problems: they fail to present their strengths, don’t manage to show a sincere interest in the job, and get caught flat-footed on fairly standard questions.  Most of these mistakes come down to a lack of preparation, not tailoring their message to their audience, and not knowing how to structure the information they know about themselves in a compelling way.  These are the skills that you’ll learn from a good class on writing, and develop through practice writing.</p>\n<p>Interviews are important, especially early on in your career.  Your compensation as you go throughout your career tends to be anchored to where you started, especially if you stay one place for a long time.  An increase of $5,000 in salary on a job you take today would mean an additional $92,000 of accumulated income over the next 15 years assuming a salary increase rate of 3% a year<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition if you write publicly on a blog like this, it can help you show proof of your knowledge in a way that a resume never will.  Not everybody needs to be publicly blogging, but if that appeals to you it can be a great career booster.</p>\n<h4>4. Remote work increases the importance of writing</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest trends in the tech industry these days is the <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/remote-workforce-rise/\">rise of remote work</a>. More teams are embracing partial remote work, and there are major companies like Buffer, Invision and GitLab that are entirely remote.  Remote work is partially enabled by video chat technology, but written communication is the lifeblood of a successful remote team. Collaborating via tools like Slack, Github, Trello and Jira is part of most teams’ workflows, but when everybody is remote, being able to express yourself clearly on these platforms is critical.</p>\n<h4>5. Your career trajectory will depend on your ability to influence and persuade</h4>\n<p>Most developers when they begin their first software job will be given a set of tasks to do and the expectation is that they will create work to the spec that somebody else has designed.  They are implementors.  But as a developers career progresses there is an opportunity to be more than an implementor.  Since developers understand the system best, they often have ideas that can help shape product designs.  Developers also often need to work with other teams whose goals may not be completely aligned with their team.  These are not situations where even a senior engineer is likely to have direct authority.  Instead the developers who continue to grow in their careers are those who are able to influence and persuade without authority.</p>\n<p>This is again a skill that writing classes can cultivate.  Persuasive writing practice can help give you the clarity of thought and intuition for structuring arguments that will help both when you’re trying to make a point through writing or doing it verbally.</p>\n<h4>6. Writing skills translate to writing code</h4>\n<p>This last one is really specific to software engineering, but I’ve found that applying writing principles to code has helped me write more maintainable code.  Most code written in a professional context will be read many times by other people (or by the original author after they have long lost track of their original context).  Being able to write code that can be understood by both a computer and by human beings is a skill developed over time, but many of the same “brain muscles” that you develop in writing prose can be applied to code: it’s important to know your audience, structure your information in a logical manner, and use judgement when finding just the right phrase (or code structure) for a situation.

When I first went through this sheet, I circled over 40 words as values that “resonated” with me.  They’re things that I value and strive for, or wish that I was more like.  Deciding between adventurousness and cowardice is not a “values decision”. A real values decision means that you’re trying to decide whether good traits like adventurousness, belonging, or clear-mindedness are more important to you.</p>\n<p>Management often forces you to choose between goods: Will we ship quicker? Aim for higher quality? How do those choices impact work/life balance for our teams?. It’s hard to know if we’re making good choices, because the results routinely lack clarity.  Indicators lag, causation is fuzzy, and we don’t get to compare to a control group.  Values can be guideposts through ambiguity.  I’ve seen the power of this at a company level in my current gig, where having a set of values that are kept in the spotlight often allows us to weaponize them as decision making tools <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Going through the list, I eventually cut things down to 20, 12, 10 and then 8.  That still feels like a lot to me, but for each of the 8 I can easily cite work situations I’ve faced in the past month where my response came directly out that value.  In the end I ended up with <em>Integrity</em>, <em>Thankfulness</em>, <em>Community</em>, <em>Prudence</em> (in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence\">classical sense</a>), <em>Generosity</em>, <em>Continual Improvement</em>, <em>Accountability</em>, <em>Justice</em>.

It leads to <strong>inspiration</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wow I’m looking at web development in a whole new way now.  This really changes how I think about my job!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea how to give a talk that inspires people.  But after speaking a decent amount over the last few years, I’ve figured out what helps me give talks that can inform most people, and avoid having people leave bored or enraged.  I want to share what I know, because the truth is that giving a talk at a conference or meetup can be fun and rewarding, and I would love it if you too got the chance to enjoy that.  So here are my tips:</p>\n<h2>The Pitch</h2>\n<h4>1. Show up!</h4>\n<p>The only way to give a talk that will interest and inform other people is to actually attempt it.  If you live in a place that has meetups, those are often the easiest place to start.  They’re usually run by 1 or 2 people who are going to be grateful to find new folks who are willing to speak. Depending on format, you may be able to give a 5 or 15 minute talk along with other speakers at a meetup to ease into things.  If there’s no meetup, you can also apply to conferences.  Almost all conferences have open “Call for Papers” periods where they invite applications, and many of them try to save some spots for new speakers.  Conference speaking is more of a crapshoot though, since they often have many applications for few spots, and your best bet is to apply widely, and possibly suggest several different talk ideas.  This year I applied to speak at 6 conferences, and actually spoke at 2, and that was by far my best ratio since I started applying to speak a few years ago.</p>\n<h4>2. Pick a topic that you’re interested in</h4>\n<p>Giving a talk can be a fun experience, but it can also be frustrating for both you and the audience.  The best way to suck all of the joy out it is to give a talk about something that you don’t care about.  If you’re uninterested in the topic, the work to prepare is either going to be a painful grind, or you won’t do it.  In which case sitting through your talk may well be a painful grind for your audience.</p>\n<p>Note that I don’t say to pick a topic you’re passionate about.  Not every talk is going to be the pinnacle of your speaking career, and sometimes there may be nothing out there that is currently changing your life.  You can really help people by sharing the useful, interesting information you have, and this doesn’t need to be more than that.</p>\n<h4>3. Pick an audience for whom that topic is relevant</h4>\n<p>So you have a talk topic, and that’s great, but does your topic make sense for the people you’re speaking to?  Sometimes when you start speaking you may pick a topic before you’re sure where you’re going to give the talk, other times you may have a place you want to speak, and you need to pick a topic for it.  Either way, make sure that you end up with a topic and an audience that match.  If you’re talking to a group of beginner web programmers, a deep dive into the Rust memory model might not be the best choice.  If you’re speaking to veteran python programmers, a talk about the basics of object oriented programming might miss its mark.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may not know your audience exactly.  This is especially true for speaking at large multi-track conferences, where there may be developers (and/or non-developers) from a variety of backgrounds.  In this case, you’ll still want to pick the audience you want to target (some subset of the group you know may be there), and then make sure to do a good job of following point #6 below.</p>\n<h4>4. Pick a “main takeaway” for your audience</h4>\n<p>It’s not enough to just have a topic and audience that generally match.  You’re also going to want to know what you want the audience to get out of it.  Talking about “debugging” to a JavaScript audience could be a good talk, but do you want them to learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to use Chrome devtools to find performance bugs?</li>\n<li>a repeatable step by step workflow for figuring out any bug?</li>\n<li>a story about how you solved a specific bug?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike the “topic”, the takeaway should be pretty specific.  Given the audience that you’re targeting, what piece(s) of new information do you want them to receive as they walk away from your talk?</p>\n<h4>5. Pick a talk format</h4>\n<p>There are a few main formats that most tech talks fall into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present a problem, describe several possible solutions (possibly recommending one)</li>\n<li>Present a tool, explain what problems it solves and give examples of using it</li>\n<li>Present an idea or way of looking at things, and show how it applies in different situations</li>\n<li>Tell your story. Explain how a certain technology, idea, or problem in the tech community has affected your life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these formats can work, for a first talk I’d recommend one of the first 2, keeping things concrete and making it easier to get to that “main takeaway”.</p>\n<h4>6. Write a description that tells your audience what to expect</h4>\n<p>The final step of putting together a pitch is writing a description that accurately lets attendees know what to expect.  A great title and description do a few things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You actually have something to submit to a meetup organizer or a conferences call for papers.</li>\n<li>A good description helps ground you as you prepare the content of the talk.  You can look at your slides and see if you’re actually focusing on the things you wanted to communicate<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>A well written title and description will help attract your target audience to your talk.  If you’re giving a talk for beginners or advanced users, or users of a particular technology, make sure that’s clear in the description.  People go out of their way to go to talks where they know they’re the target audience, and nothing kills the mood of a talk than a situation where the talk isn’t relevant to most of the audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in general, a good description matters more than the exact title of the talk, but if you’re at a multi-track conference, make sure to give a descriptive title, as conferences will often only include the talk name in their schedules, without a top-level description.  Naming your talk about the creative uses of Golang “Go-ing Crazy” is fine for a Go meetup, but if people are going to be choosing what session to attend based on your talks name, something more descriptive would be nice, even if it has a little less personality.</p>\n<h2>The Preparation</h2>\n<h4>7. Have slides</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some amazing live-coding talks.  I’ve given one myself at a meetup.  There is definitely a place for them, as well as for minimally visual talks with 2-3 slides.  But if you’re aiming for informative, structuring your talk around a good slide deck is your best bet.</p>\n<p>Slides shouldn’t have too much information: they’re the backbone of your talk, and aren’t meant to stand alone<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  Instead, they provide structure both for you and the audience as you move through your presentation.</p>\n<h4>8. Have a talk track</h4>\n<p>Slides are good, but they’re just the start.  You need a talk track that is more than just “reading off my slides”.  To feel really well prepared for a talk, I usually write out a complete script for the talk that I intend to follow, and then edit that after several practice run throughs.  For the actual talk I usually boil most of that script down to bullet points to keep me focused.  There will be some experimentation needed there to figure out what works best for you.</p>\n<h4>9. Make sure your A/V setup works!</h4>\n<p>I was reminded just last week about the importance of testing that you can give your talk in the venue you’re speaking at with the equipment you have as early as possible.  I was forced to give a talk last week on my manager’s laptop after mine failed to connect to the venue’s projector.  It ended up being a dumb problem on my side that I could have solved if I’d verified my setup earlier and had more time to figure things out.  So that’s my a/v setup parable.  The things to remember here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show up early and test your setup if at all possible (event organizers are usually happy to help with this and may insist on this)</li>\n<li>Bring your own adapters.  In the US, at least be ready to connect to HDMI and VGA.  I can’t speak to what might be common internationally, but at the very least it’s good to be paranoid</li>\n<li>Make sure to bring a power cable.  Your slides going black in the middle of your talk is not a good look.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Delivery</h2>\n<h4>10. Have notes</h4>\n<p>So now it is time to actually give your talk.  Make sure to bring notes.  Most presentation software programs like Powerpoint and Keynote have nice built in presenter note features for this (make sure to practice setting it up so that you see the notes and the audience just sees the slide). You also can just use paper notes in a notebook. Notes are important to keep you on track in case you freeze, and may be something you just want to read for portions of the talk.</p>\n<p>Here again you have several choices for how to handle notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can read your talk from a script. This lowers your ability to connect with your audience, but it is low risk, and you’ll guarantee that you’ll hit the content you intend to.  As a native english speaker, I probably underrate this a bit too.  If you’re presenting in a second language and reading can help you confidently deliver the material, it may be worth doing so.</li>\n<li>You can work off of bullet point notes, which were ideally pulled out of a full script that you wrote originally.  So you’re talking naturally, with some notes to give you structure and help pull you back in if you’re fumbling around.</li>\n<li>You can memorize your talk verbatim.  This is hard and high risk (if you forget something it can become an awkward stumble as you try to get back to your script), but has a chance at being a very compelling experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have found that bullet point notes work well for me, but if you’re great at memorizing things, or would be more comfortable reading and are ok with sacrificing some connection to the audience, all 3 can work.</p>\n<h4>11. Give context and set expectations (again)</h4>\n<p>At the start of your talk, you want to answer 3 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are you?</li>\n<li>Who is this for?</li>\n<li>What are you going to be talking about?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may think you answered these questions with your description, but there will definitely be people at your talk who didn’t read your description, and others who misread it.  Giving context at the beginning of your talk helps people prepare to hear the things that matter in your talk.  If this is a conference, it lets people decide whether they want to stay for your talk or not.  Don’t be discouraged if some people walk out of your talk after your explanation.  That’s a sign that you’ve done a good job clarifying the scope of your talk, and honoring their time. Having those folks leave now will be a much better experience than having them staring at Facebook and distracting others through out your talk, and it is now more likely that the people in front of you are the audience you wanted to address.</p>\n<h4>12. Be Confident and Grateful</h4>\n<p>When you know your topic and you’ve prepared well, the actual speaking part will usually end up being the easiest part.  So be confident.  Not because you’re already a great speaker, or because of some feeling of baseless optimism, but because you’ve done the work to be ready and you have the structure around you to succeed.  Also make sure to be grateful.  A bunch of people showed up to hear you speak.  Appreciate them, give them your best and hopefully try to answer their questions.  Speaking is a great opportunity, and I hope you get the chance to try it.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rands has a <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/archives/out-loud/\">great post</a> on preparing for a presentation.

It seemed generally applicable, so here’s a cleaned up version of what I shared.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What Is Value?</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to think of software engineering work as a series of task where you’re given instructions and you make the computer do what the designer / PM / CEO asked.  Or as a series of fun problem solving challenges that you’re somehow getting paid to complete.  Both of those views will eventually lead you to make suboptimal decisions when it comes to helping your business and growing in your role though.  Instead consider the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software Developers create value through shipping working code that solves important user problems in a predictable manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This captures a number of important things.</p>\n<h3>Shipping</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real Artists Ship - <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineer’s super power compared to other roles is that we get to build.  We create new things, add new behaviors, and ultimately (for a product company) control the shape of the product our company is built around.  This only has value when software actually ships though.  When we’re not shipping, it’s actually worse than just being slow to deliver value, because of a few non-obvious factors.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>unshipped code rots.</strong>  When we leave code in a branch 90% done, it doesn’t just stay the same.  It’s quite common for our situation to get worse.  Our teammates check in code that may cause merge conflicts, or worse just doesn’t take into account the unshipped code and sets us up for subtle bugs.  And when we do get back to the work we’ve often lost valuable mental context that makes any remaining work or testing harder and more error-prone.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we learn from shipping!</strong>  It’s quite common in software development for a developer or team to complete 90% of their feature according to the spec, only to find that they have another 90% of the work to go.  Doing the work to push things through to production inherently de-risks things, because we learn what the challenges are, and we know how long the work took.  Up until then, we will always have unknowns.  And when software goes out to users, we get to hear their feedback as well.  Shipped software lets us learn from our users (and from the performance of our system) and make adjustments that we wouldn’t have known about if we sat on the code.  </p>\n<p>So how do we get to shipping?  First, it’s important to push things through to completion rather than allowing ourselves to jump from project to project, making progress without finishing, and incurring a lot of cost from context switching.  Soemtimes this may mean imposing kanban style <a href=\"https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/\">work in progress limits</a> on ourselves.  Second, its often helpful to break things into smaller chunks.  Small code reviews are easier to complete, test, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/22/better-code-feedback\">review</a> and verify.  So multiple small changes will often go through faster than the same changes bundled together into a big chunk.  This can go too far, but as long as your changes work in isolation and provide value, I’d encourage erring on this side when in doubt.</p>\n<h3>Working Code</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[We Prefer] working software over comprehensive documentation - <em>The Agile Manifesto</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software engineers are responsible for their code working.  At the simplest level that means delivering code that doesn’t crash when run in the intended way.  As we grow and mature as developers however, we should aspire to  learn to write code that will scale to any reasonable load the system might see (and maybe even to unreasonable loads), code that handles odd input or context gracefully, and code that is easy to modify and maintain.  We should also take responsibility for proving that it works; writing tests, making the code easy to monitor in production, and providing good logging for debugging all fall under a software engineer’s domain. We also should make sure that our definition of working matches what the business needs, not just a pedantic reading of whatever spec we’re working off of.  More on that in a moment.</p>\n<h3>Solving Important User Problems</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just really funny- What the Customer Wanted expanded <a href=\"https://t.co/kdr7HKTSDy\">pic.twitter.com/kdr7HKTSDy</a></p>&mdash; Frank Spillers (@farreaching) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/farreaching/status/764256002053025792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineers can be quite inventive in the ways they write code without solving important user problems.  Some common routes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working on their own pet projects over the prioritized business problems</strong> - Tech improvement work and engineer-driven projects are part of a healthy organization, but if they consistently replace work that was scoped based on user requests / feedback, they can cause problems</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec without solving the original problem</strong> - This is partially a design/product problem, but its often possible to meet all the stated requirements for a project without solving the original user pain point.  Great engineers understand exactly what problem they’re trying to solve with a feature and will always step back to evaluate whether they’re succeeding throughout the development process.</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec and causing new problems</strong> - Oftentimes our efforts to fix cause or expose new problems.  When we dodge responsibility by ignoring or hiding those problems instead of openly evaluating tradeoffs or working to improve the solution, we’re not providing all the value we’re capable of. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are ultimately issues of ownership. When we’re invested in our work, we will want to work on useful problems and make sure they produce real value.  If you’re consistently not feeling that way, it may be time to find something else to work on.</p>\n<h3>In a predictable manner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources - <em>Fred Brooks</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, now we come to the section that is the <em>boring part</em> for many software engineers.  But as somebody who has recently converted to the management side of the fence, the ability to ship predictably is incredibly important.  </p>\n<p>It’s important for software engineers to ship predictably in 2 senses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of when something is likely to ship among the people who need to know</li>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of how something will work when it will ship among the people who need to know.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Estimating software engineering projects is not an exact science. Nobody reasonable expects estimation perfection from software engineers, especially those new to the field.  Instead we aim to be as accurate as possible, and especially to be transparent as those estimates change over time.  </p>\n<p>When we encounter obstacles, it’s important to be realistic about what they mean to schedules and update the important people in a timely manner. </p>\n<p>For those working on a product team that may be a manager and a PM, for those building something solo, that may be the customers or internal users of the software directly.  It’s never fun to say something is going to be late, but its always better to say that we’ll miss a date that is 2 weeks away than to tell somebody for the first time that you’ve missed the date that was 2 days ago.</p>\n<p>Communicating about the scope of work is just as important as schedule.  If we find out a piece of a feature is unfeasable or we dropped it due to time pressure, its important to communicate that.  Depending on your team/product, that may mean sharing with people directly, updating documentation, or just making the new behavior clear in an interface.   </p>\n<h3>It’s a process</h3>\n<p>Nobody starts out their first software engineering job with a fully evolved sense of how to estimate, scope and document their work.  Most have no clue how to think about building a system to be scalable or when to escalate problems to other members of the team.  These are skills learned through hard experience.  Make sure to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/05/18/obvious-things\">always be reflecting</a> on what you’re experiencing though.  Experience combined with reflection is a powerful mixture, and eventually will lead to growth.

It explicitly focused on the set of technical skills that you need to become a “senior” JavaScript developer.  While I’m happy with that post, I’ve always wanted to revisit the idea, because it is my strong belief that <em>once you’ve hit a minimum level of technical capability, only about 20% of career success is determined by your technical skills</em>.  The other 80% is composed of skills that can be loosely bundled under “soft skills”.</p>\n<p>You may quibble with my choice of percentage, but I don’t think the underlying idea that things other than technical ability is particularly controversial.  Even if they bitterly dismiss such things as “politics” most developers are aware that their careers are impacted by things that go beyond their ability to write algorithms.  What I haven’t seen much of however, are attempts to catalogue what these soft skills are, and how somebody might get better at them.  The second part is outside of the scope of a single post, though I will attempt to list resources here.  But the first is achievable, and that is what I will attempt to do here.</p>\n<p>The following is not an exhaustive list, but it covers 10 “soft skills” that I’ve seen have a clear impact on my career in software and those of others.  The best part? These are things you can grow in that will have an impact in your life outside of work, and in any career you might transition into in the future.</p>\n<h3>The Skills</h3>\n<h4>1. Clear Communication</h4>\n<p>While I’m making bold statements: A developer’s ability to communicate clearly is the single most important skill in determining the trajectory of their career.  Poor communicators are forced to rely on others to interpret their work, even when it is brilliant.  They will often create problems for others through miscommunications or lead teams to make suboptimal decisions because they were not able to explain the technical considerations involved in a situation.</p>\n<p>Great communicators on the other hand, enlighten.  They help teams understand what is really going on so that non-technical team members can make good decisions, and technical folk can work with confidence.  Great communicators cut through misunderstandings, expose ambiguity and poor assumptions, and can translate for team members who are having trouble making themselves heard.</p>\n<p>Communication skills are important for those on a management track, but they are just as important for those on a technical trajectory. Architects, Principal Engineers and Tech Leads must coordinate with many teams, teach less experienced developers, explain technical tradeoffs and document decisions and code.  Those are core parts of a senior technical employee’s job, and all of them come down to communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing\">The Importance Of Writing For Software Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codingame.com/blog/10-tips-to-improve-your-communication-skills-as-a-software-developer/\">10 Tips to Improve your Communication Skills as a Software Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Attention Management</h4>\n<p>This one is more commonly referred to as “time management”, but I agree with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">this recent NYT Op-Ed</a>: the mechanics of how we organize our time is less important than whether we end up spending it on the most important things.  This broadly encompasses the ability to prioritize, to prevent distractions from wreaking havoc on productivity, and the ability to find ways to get back on track when things go wrong or priorities change.</p>\n<p>This was a weakness for me early in my career: I got things done but often did them haphazardly or inefficiently.  One of my biggest sources of growth in the last few years has been finding ways to structure and prioritize my time better, while cutting out distractions.  This has been necessary due to life changes: I’m now a parent and have people reporting to me at work.  I wouldn’t be able to meet my current responsibilities with the habits I had as a 25 year old.  For me this has been largely about focusing in on a small amount of essential things and actively removing less important things from my life.  For others it may be more about establishing patterns and limits.  Either way, this requires planning and introspection first to be effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR\">Deep Work - Cal Newport</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scheduling-every-minute-of-my-day/\">Scheduling Every Minute of My Day - Brad Frost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">Productivity Isn’t About Time Management, It’s about Attention Management - Adam Grant</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Initiative</h4>\n<p>If you see an opportunity or a problem, do you do something about it?  I’ve been reading a good amount of “manager books” recently, and in many of them a surprising amount of focus is dedicated to the question of how we create conditions when people are “empowered” to act.  And there certainly is an environmental factor here.  People are more likely to take initiative and risks when they’re not afraid of being punished for it.  But the individual also controls a lot here.  Developers who are willing to step up and take initiative in a situation can make an outsize impact.</p>\n<p>Do you have a piece of code or process on your team that everybody acknowledges is a bit wonky, but nobody has ever taken the time to fix even though it is slowly taking a toll on the team over time?  Are there simple things that you know could make your product better, but nobody has quite taken the time to get to them?  Those are the opportunities that initiative can turn into value.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/fix-like-no-ones-watching/\">Fix Like No One’s Watching</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Empathy</h4>\n<p>There is no meaningful software product that has been created in isolation.  One person may have written the code (though that is quite rare for software with any scale of impact), and maybe even didn’t collaborate with anyone to handle distribution / hosting etc, but if that software is used by others there is always support, training and marketing to consider.  You can create a todo app for yourself without talking to anyone.  But nobody makes a career in this business without talking to other humans.</p>\n<p>The thing about us humans; we work well with people who we trust, and who we perceive as caring about us.  We also are for the most part exceptionally good at discerning when somebody is faking it.  So if we can’t get away from humans, and we can’t be fake, what can we do?  We are left with, in the words of Dale Carnegie “becoming genuinely interested in other people”.  If you’re currently filled with red-faced frustration at your annoying co-worker or manipulative boss, this may seem like asking for a miracle. And arguably any time we look outside ourselves it is a miracle. But regardless of your philosophical outlook on such things, there are definitely ways we can improve in how we work with and care for the people around us.  And it starts with trying to empathize and seeing the people around us as human beings and not obstacles or tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iiooe4\">How To Win Friends And Influence People - Dale Carnegie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YSZasy\">Radical Candor - Kimball Scott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WVkqfv\">I Hear You - Michael Sorenson</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5. Negotiation &#x26; Persuasion</h4>\n<p>You may not think that Software Engineering involves much negotiation.  But that is only true if you use a shallow definition of negotiation.  Every time a team debates implementation strategies for a feature, which tickets should end up in a sprint, and how much time to spend chasing a difficult to reproduce bug, they are engaging in negotiation, and team members are attempting to persuade.  And there is a wealth of knowledge out there describing how to improve on these skills.</p>\n<p>A word of caution here; unlike some of the other things on this list, these skills can often be dangerous when they’re improved in isolation.  When developers complain about politics trumping technical ability, they’re often experiencing decisions being made based on the ability of some employees to persuade and negotiate.  When those employees are not actually providing the best ideas this is suboptimal.  For the technically skilled employees, the answer is to learn to persuade better.  But for those who can negotiate we always need to make sure that we’re <strong>persuading for good</strong>.  Just like the loudest voices shouldn’t always win, when you can communicate well, make sure to stay humble and  boost other’s good ideas when you see them.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OUBnnl\">Negotiation Genius - Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6. Continual Learning</h4>\n<p>Were you paying attention in high school physics when they taught about the difference between distance, velocity, and acceleration?  Distance is the amount an object has traveled.  Velocity is the speed at which it is currently moving in a given direction.  Acceleration is the rate at which the object’s velocity is changing.  If you want to know where an object is <em>right now</em>, distance is the only thing that matters.  But as time progresses, velocity starts to matter more, and in the very long term any difference in acceleration will be the only thing that matters.</p>\n<p>The same ideas play out when acquiring skills.  If you need to evaluate your career potential for the next few months, the skills and accomplishments you’ve acquired so far (distance) are the only things that matter.  But if you want to think about your career potential over the next 30 years, the new skills you’re acquiring (velocity) and even more importantly your ability to get better at learning new things (acceleration) will matter much much more. Learning is a skill unto itself, and the earlier you invest in it the more dividends it will pay over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/\">Learning To Learn - Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js\">How To Keep Learning JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>7. Self Care</h4>\n<p>Another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way in my career is the reality of my own mortality.  None of us are indestructible, and our bodies are not perpetual energy machines.  They require care and maintenance.  Our souls too are not meant to run on work alone, and we can burn out hard without sufficient rest.  This is all aside from deeper issues of disease and mental health that can change our lives in even more profound and difficult ways.</p>\n<p>Self care is a career skill because frankly we are great at deluding ourselves into thinking we’re functioning normally while we’ve compromised ourselves.  <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2014/07/you-might-not-know-if-youre-sleep-deprived.html\">Research</a> shows that we are horrible judges of whether our judgement and creativity are compromised by lack of sleep.  Because we can’t run controlled studies on ourselves, we don’t really know whether our lack of exercise or 60 hour workweek induced burnout are hurting our creativity.  But research suggests it is for pretty much everybody.</p>\n<p>Healthy socialization, sleeping, eating and exercise ultimately lead to better emotional stability, ability to focus, and creativity.  But even aside from the career benefits, when we’re devouring our bodies and minds for work, it leads to a question of what we’re doing this for in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OVBpvx\">Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work &#x26; The Common Rule</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>8. Business Awareness</h4>\n<p>Do you know what your company actually does?  Do you understand why the features you’re building are important, and the relative priority of them?  Can you explain the business tradeoffs involved when you’re making an software architecture decision between performance and security?</p>\n<p>In companies larger than a few people it’s not ultimately developers’ jobs to make business decisions.  But understanding the context for those decisions helps us better prioritize our time, make good tradeoffs, and call attention to inefficiencies or counterproductive behavior in our products. In addition, nobody wants to spend time working on things that don’t matter. But when we try to innovate without understanding the broader business, we often end up doing just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology\">Choose Boring Technology - Dan McKinley</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>9. Marketing and Branding</h4>\n<p>Marketing is a dirty word in engineering circles.  Many take the attitude of the Dilbert comics that <a href=\"https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-05-02\">marketing is a synonym for exaggeration lying, and fraud</a>.  But at it’s core marketing is just making sure that the people who could benefit from your services are aware of those services.  This has several applications to developers.  In the job market, finding ways to let employers know who you are and what you’re capable of is important.  But in medium to large companies it also is important to do some level of internal marketing; to make sure you’re credited for the work you’ve done and that people understand it’s values.  Developers who consider themselves above this or dismiss it as politics do so at their own peril.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/single-post/2019/02/17/7-Common-Content-Marketing-Mistakes-Developers-Make-and-How-to-Avoid-Them\">7 Common Content Marketing Mistakes Developers Make and How to Avoid Them - Stephanie Morillo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>10. Character</h4>\n<p>The final item here is in some ways an oddball.  While the other 9 things on this list are skills that you can work on, character is something deeper.  Questions of what good character is and how you develop it are way outside the scope of this post.  And I would personally consider any attempt to improve your character for solely utilitarian career reasons to be ultimately hollow.  But character is undeniably important in your career.</p>\n<p>Do the people around you trust you?  Do they believe that you’re trying to do the right thing?  If the answers are no, you may find obstacles in the most unexpected places.  If the answers are yes, you will eventually find help from people you would never have looked to.</p>\n<p>In addition, as an industry, technology has the power to shape the world, and as practitioners we all get the chance to impact our little corners of the world.  It’s worth considering not just whether we’re “succeeding in our career”, but what impact we’re having on the world around us.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I5jP7K\">Future Ethics - Cennydd Bowles</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/15/soft-skills"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"following-js-roadmap,jest-git,orthogonality-css-js","topics":["javaScript","career"],"category":"javascript","key":"ten-things-js","title":"Ten Things A Serious JavaScript Developer Should Learn","description":"Some of the important things to pick up in the JS world","layout":"post","path":"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/","date":"2017-07-19T04:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>There’s been an interesting Reddit thread circling my corner of the internet for the last week or so. It started with a question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m inviting pure opinion here, but what’s your list of ten things that everyone looking for a good javascript role should know and understand. Personally, I’m in a role where what I know is adequate, but I want to be somewhere better; somewhere that has some flippin standards. I’m learning outside of work requirements at the moment, but there is so much to learn out there.\nThe objective is to do good work in a good place.\nNarrow it down to your ten for me, or for you..\n<em>- From <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6mlc9d/what_10_things_should_a_serious_javascript/\">“What 10 Things Should a Serious Javascript Developer Know Right Now?”</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a great question if you take it seriously, because when you think about it critically, it exposes all of the things JavaScript don’t really <strong>need</strong> to know.  Can you contribute productively as a mid-level JavaScript developer without knowing anything about <a href=\"https://github.com/prettier/prettier\">Prettier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> or <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>?  Sure!  Can you contribute productively if you’re writing and testing your JavaScript using <em>&#x3C;awful uncool code editor that you the reader can’t stand></em>?  Definitely.  So here’s my take on answering the question.</p>\n<h2>Assumptions</h2>\n<p>I’m making the following assumptions about the question</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I’m assuming the audience is a developer who has some level of professional programming experience and some existing JavaScript experience, and that they are primarily interested in “code skill” answers. Thus I’ll exclude things like communication ability, experience with version control, professional conduct, or basic coding ability that are very important to success in a JavaScript development environment but are out of the scope of this question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I’m optimizing for “what specific pre-existing knowledge will make the most difference between success and failure for a new hire in a mid-level JavaScript role”.  </p>\n<p><strong>Pre-existing</strong> means that these are things that somebody is expected to know before taking the job.  Learning the details of a company’s technology stack, style guide and engineering philosophy are all important, but you shouldn’t be expected to know them in advance, and in many cases doing so is impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific knowledge</strong> means that these are things that you can learn with some effort and study.  They should not be broad categories like “security”, “design”, or “server-side development”.  They  should be things you know or know how to do, not things you “have experience with”.  And they should be specific enough that somebody can feel comfortable saying they understand the topic or don’t. Most of the things I list below are <em>topics</em>, but I try to lay out a specific set of things that you would need to know to understand it.</p>\n<p><strong>The most difference between success and failure</strong> means that these are the things that are really going to make a difference in how effective you are at understanding and completing the work assigned to you.  There are many such things, and their importance will vary situationally, so this is just my educated take on a generalists list.  </p>\n<p>When I say <strong>mid-level</strong>, I’m picturing hiring for a role that pays well but is not the most senior person on the team.  This would be a developer who would be expected to complete tasks with minimal help and oversight but wouldn’t necessarily be planning the architecture of everything right off the bat.  To be clear this list is not a set of things that you need to go to get paid to write JavaScript.  It is more along the lines of “next steps” for junior devs.  Its also not a step function where you need to know all of these at once to get to the next level.  These are just things that may limit you if you don’t have them.</p>\n<p>I’m taking the liberty to assume that <strong>JavaScript role</strong> implies using JavaScript in some sort of client/UI environment (Browser, React Native, Cordova, Electron, etc).  This list would be at least a bit different for a Node.js server-side role, and somebody else will have to write that post.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The List</h2>\n<h4>1. You should know the core language</h4>\n<p>JavaScript is not a very complicated language at its core.  It can seem difficult to learn because of all of the noise around it.  Browser APIs, Library APIs, jQuery, React, TypeScript, the many npm packages out there, etc all can make the language syntax space seem huge.  And this isn’t helped by the fact that the language has evolved over time so you’ll see many different ways to do a single task spread out over the internet.  But the core language and standard libraries are actually pretty small compared to languages like Python and Java that have more features and larger standard libraries.  Eventually you’ll need the ecosystem.  But knowing the core language features that are implemented in most browsers is a great start.  </p>\n<p>This means you should know about basic language features like if/else, error handling with throw/try/catch, array manipulation with push/map/reduce/filter, and string manipulation methods like replace/slice/split.  You should also know about how JavaScript handles things like truthiness and falsiness<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, how to work with JSON data with the JSON object methods, and how variable scope works in JavaScript.  These days its also becoming more and more important to have at least a basic familiarity with the more important language features that were added in ES6 like Promises, modules, classes, template literals, generators and destructuring. Even if you choose not to use those features, being able to see and understand them will help you learn faster from others.</p>\n<p>This list is mostly unordered, but this comes first because learning everything else becomes a lot harder without this knowledge, mostly because it becomes difficult to learn from other people’s code since you won’t understand what it is doing.  If you’re starting from a weak base here I’d recommend finding a good book on the core language like <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uD4R1Y\">Eloquent JavaScript</a><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> and digging in.  If you’ve been using JavaScript in an older code base or haven’t used it in a while and want to catch up, you can see <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/\">my post on keeping up with new language features</a>.</p>\n<h4>2. You should understand async code</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest leaps for new JavaScript developers, even those who are experienced with other languages is the amount of asynchronous code found in idiomatic JavaScript.  Asynchronous (async) code is code that is scheduled to run at a later time after some event, delay or response.  It can appear a bunch of different ways in JavaScript code, and it’s important to be able to interpret them.</p>\n<p>This means learning about <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2015/12/30/es6-patterns-converting-callbacks-to-promises/\">callbacks and promises</a> at least.   You should also learn about the JavaScript <a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/\">event loop</a> and how it works  Ideally some of the standard APIs that use them like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Talk:DOM/window.setTimeout\">setTimeout</a> and  <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch\">fetch</a>.  If you’re ambitious you can learn about newer async syntax and library implementations like <a href=\"https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await\">async-await</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS\">RxJS</a> But the most important thing is to spend time using and writing async code so that you get an intuitive understanding of how it works.</p>\n<h4>3. You should get comfortable with at least one set of developer tools</h4>\n<p>When developing JavaScript, its important to be able to debug problems and understand how existing systems work.  JavaScript has a fantastic ecosystem of developer tools for diagnosing bugs and examining application code.  For the most part they’re bundled with browsers (though some IDEs like VS Code and WebStorm have their own debuggers).  Learning how to use these tools well will turbocharge your JS dev skills.  If you can’t use them though, it will make everything much harder.  </p>\n<p>Competence in this means comfort with at least the JavaScript debugger panel of a browser’s devtools.  You should be able to set and use breakpoints, use watch mode and the console to test for the value of expressions, and understand the stack traces. But its also good to get comfortable using the elements panel to understand and manipulate the DOM, and the network panel to debug network requests.</p>\n<h4>4. You should be proficient with JavaScript functions</h4>\n<p>Functions are the core of the JavaScript language.  You should be able to use them fluently.  That means understanding function scope, closures, how <code class=\"language-text\">this</code> works, and the difference between normal functions and arrow functions. It also means knowing about how to process arrays with function using methods like map, filter, and reduce.  A good resource for “thinking in functions” is <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read\">JavaScript Allonge</a> by Reginald Braithwaite.</p>\n<h4>5. You should be comfortable with basic design tasks</h4>\n<p>No matter how well you learn JavaScript, you’ll be limited career-wise if you can’t manage basic design tasks.  This might not seem inherently true; after all isn’t that what professional designers are for?  But the truth is that unless you’re a purely server-side developer (excluded by our assumptions above), there will be times when you’re asked to fill in a visual gap that a designer doesn’t have time for, or there will be ambiguities in a designers spec that aren’t worth a meeting.  And learning the basics of design will help you communicate better with designers and product managers about technical constraints and design requirements.  </p>\n<p>When I talk design, I mean both the basics of implementing a visual design with HTML and CSS<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>, and enough of an understanding of design basics to create a simple UI that looks ok and isn’t confusing.  That last requirement is harder than you’d think.  Design is hard and mostly orthogonal to the set of skills most folks pick up while learning to code.  For learning design theory, I’d recommend finding a simple resource on visual design first like <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uz3vEG\">White Space is Not Your Enemy</a>, and ideally supplementing that with a more UX focused resource like <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2uvUrR7\">Don’t Make Me Think</a>.  The practical side of HTML/CSS is easiest to pick up with experience.  If you’re using devtools you can see what other people are doing with CSS and tweak and explore using the elements panel.  And there are lots of good online resources for learning about CSS and HTML syntax like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN</a> for API info or <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS-Tricks</a> for ideas, tutorials and keeping up with new stuff.</p>\n<h4>6. You should have a basic understanding of networking and HTTP-based APIs</h4>\n<p>Because we’re assuming that this job involves using JavaScript in a browser or other client context, you should be able to understand the basics of networking.  You should know what a client and server is.  You should be able to explain a rough approximation of what happens when somebody enters a URL into the browser<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>. There’s a bunch of vocabulary thats good to know here. You should know what an HTTP request is and ideally know the conventions of what GET/PUT/POST/DELETE imply.  It will help you to have a working definition of what REST is and what AJAX is. It’s good to get experience working with some HTTP based APIs, either at work or playing around with an API like <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v3/\">Github</a>.  You should also get familiar with at least one way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript (XMLHttpRequest, fetch, jQuery’s ajax methods).  </p>\n<h4>7. You should be comfortable with Node.js based tooling</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest shifts in the last 5 years in the JavaScript world has been the explosive growth and consolidation of tools to help build JavaScript applications.  Tools like <a href=\"http://eslint.org/\">eslint</a>, <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a>, and <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> are essential to many teams workflows.  While you don’t necessarily have to be experienced writing applications for Node.js, it is important that you be able to use those tools.  That means knowing how to install Node and use npm to install and update packages.  It also means getting comfortable with build tools like Webpack, Rollup or Ember CLI and knowing how to use them.  Reasonable people can differ on how many tools and libraries you should be using, or what the right ones to use are, but having a basic familiarity with how the Node ecosystem works has become essential.</p>\n<h4>8. You should know how to use a framework to structure a moderately sized program</h4>\n<p>A critical requirement for a developer who is expected to complete work with minimum supervision or hand-holding is the ability to structure their code in a maintainable way.  That means having an understanding of (or helping define) the overall architecture of the system, and then writing code that fits into it.  It also means being able to identify and help solve situations where the current architecture or code base norms causes problems.  I put this in terms of frameworks because pretty much all medium to large JavaScript programs are using some sort of framework, whether it is an “official” framework like React, Angular, and Ember or a collection of helper files and functions cobbled together by a development team over time.  For learning purposes, the popular official frameworks will usually be better to learn, since the knowledge can translate elsewhere, the purposes behind the structure are documented on the internet, and at least some sense of best practice architecture should be embedded in the code.  To check this box I think it would be best to get experience with at least 2 frameworks/architectures, since it is difficult to tell which decisions a Framework makes are specific to its architecture and constraints without something to compare it with.</p>\n<p>This is probably the most controversial item on this list, since I know a lot of folks believe it’s better to learn architecture ideas outside the constraints of a framework.  My stance here is that frameworks are practical: they’re most likely to translate to an actual employment background and it’s easy to find practical explanations of how they solve architecture problems.  </p>\n<h4>9. You should know the basics of JavaScript program performance</h4>\n<p>Like design, performance is a deep well of things you can learn.  But knowing the basics is important and can go a long ways.  For performance “the basics” is more about process than knowledge.  You need to learn how to debug slow processes and understand where the problems are coming from.  For browser environments in particular there are some baseline things to understand.  You’ll want to be able to tell the difference between code that is running slowly due to parsing slowness, runtime slowness, and network latency.  It’s important to learn how to keep a UI responsive and not block rendering with other calculations.  And it’s great to understand how to cache data and avoid making too many requests to the server.  </p>\n<p>This is also an area where learning more about Computer Science theory can be beneficial.  Studying data structures and algorithms can help give you good intuitions on how to handle data, and learning about Big O notation gives you a language for discussing performance tradeoffs.  This is the type of background knowledge that pays off in occasional subtle ways though, not something that is always obvious applicable in the moment.</p>\n<h4>10. You should have a process for learning new things</h4>\n<p>JavaScript development has changed a lot over the last 10 years, and there’s no reason to think it won’t continue to evolve over the next 10.  There are also a lot of different technologies that fall under the umbrella of JavaScript, more than any one person can keep in their head.  So it’s important to be able to keep up with the new technologies as they come along, and also learn about new technologies quickly when you need them.  Ideally this means having at least one place where you can follow news about new JavaScript innovation.  Could be Twitter, a set of blogs, newsletters or an aggregator site like Reddit or Hacker News.  If you’re looking for an easy place to start, I’d recommend the <a href=\"http://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly mailing list</a>.  </p>\n<p>You also need to get comfortable finding information about specific technologies, either to learn to use them or troubleshoot problems.  These resources will likely be more varied, but it’s important to learn to <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/627/\">Google well</a>, and also helpful to get familiar with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> or some other resource for getting help when you have specific questions or problems.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Do you have a different list?

This is my answer. Note that it is focused on leveling up for folks with existing programming experience, not giving the best pathway into the field.</em></p>\n<p>I’m going to break this up into 3 parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The different ways people tackle learning new programming things</li>\n<li>An inventory of the different types of resources out there for learning programming</li>\n<li>My specific recommendations for JavaScript and React resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first 3 are going to be generalizable to any type of learning about programming you want to pursue (and probably other fields as well).  The last one is necessarily more specific.</p>\n<h4>Learning Strategies</h4>\n<p>It’s helpful to start by talking about the different ways that people learn programming concepts.  We can break things up into 3 categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practical</strong>:  This is where you work on projects and pursue goals, and learn the things you need as you need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Topical</strong>: This is when you commit to learning something about a certain set of topics that you think will be valuable.  This may be related to work you’re doing, but your goal is a deep understanding of the topic moreso than trying to solve a specific problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Serendipitous</strong>: This type of learning isn’t directed at all.  You’re just diving into learning as you encounter new terms or concepts, trying to absorb and understand everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So which one is best?  You’ll hear arguments for all three, but personally I see learning like investing; it’s a long term game that you can’t win in a day, the gains accumulate slowly until suddenly you’re a long way from where you started, and one of the keys is diversifying.</p>\n<p>Practical knowledge is safe; when you focus on learning things you need, you’ll rarely waste your time, will likely get more done, and will put yourself in a position to learn more interesting things as you develop a reputation for doing good work.  However focusing solely on learning the things you need to do your current job may blind you to trends and eventually leave you with an out of date skill set. In addition, while you may be looking for answers to practical problems, if your knowledge base is narrow to start you may miss out on innovative ideas because you don’t have exposure to solutions that might not “google well” for the way you think of your current needs.</p>\n<p>Topical knowledge can be very useful when jumping into a new area of work: sometimes you just need a level of exposure to the syntax, concepts and tools behind a language, framework or project before you can effectively work with it.  But learning about a topic divorced from a project can sometimes feel more productive in the moment than it actually ends up being: without practical experience of the pain points that the topic is solving for and/or causing, it can be hard to know what is important and make the connections that you really need. Topical learning can also devolve into a purely academic exercise where you never really learn to apply what you know.</p>\n<p>Serendipitous learning on the face of it is the most easily wasted; trying to learn everything can be overwhelming in programming, a field based on layers of abstractions, with a plethora of different subfields that can be explored for years without learning everything. However sometimes it is the dash of inspiration that comes from bringing previously disconnected ideas together that leads to the creation of something novel and great.  And those types of connection only come from somebody who is learning broadly as well as deeply.  Being curious also prevents the pitfalls of purely practical learning: dead-ends and blind spots. So there is a place for serendipitous learning too.</p>\n<p>The best approach is a mix of the 3: have real problems that you’re trying to solve, but make sure to keep an eye out for interesting things, and don’t be afraid of the occasional deep dive into a useful sounding topic.</p>\n<h3>Resource Types</h3>\n<p>There are so many ways to learn things in the programming world.  Below is a brief roundup of resource types, ordered roughly in terms of stability and how rapidly they produce new material.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Courses</strong> - College, bootcamps, Coursera, etc:  These are the ultimate in topical learning.  Not something that most people are doing every day, but can be great for rebooting a career if you want to head in a new direction or refresh after being away from the field for a while.</li>\n<li><strong>Books</strong> - People are still writing programming books.  These tend to fall into 2 categories: books about a specific framework or technique and more “timeless” books about some fundamental part of how we write software. The first group tends. to age fast but can be great for topical learning, the second are an essential resource for “higher level” thinking about our field.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Courses</strong> - In recent years, video courses seem to have grown in popularity as a way of teaching programming.  They’ve never been my cup of tea, but they can be great topical guides to new subjects for visual learners who don’t want to commit to a full academic course.</li>\n<li><strong>Wikis</strong> - There are several places online where developers aggregate documentation in an open way.  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> are the most prominent.  These can be an excellent authoritative source to start looking for answers that still are able to remain relevant as best practices and trends change.</li>\n<li><strong>Blogs</strong> -  Blogs come in a variety of flavors.  They can be focused profitable publishing platforms with multiple authors like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> or occasionally updates on a variety of topics from an individual developer.  They tend to be the best source for in depth “how tos” on niche topics that might not justify a book or be fully covered by a wiki.</li>\n<li><strong>Podcasts</strong> - There are lots of developer podcasts out there.  Due to the audio nature of the medium, they tend to be more focused on high level ideas and less likely to drift into the nitty gritty of code.</li>\n<li><strong>Newsletters</strong> - Newsletters like this one can be a great way to get regular updates from knowledgeable developers or receive aggregations of interesting links. I’ve personally found them more and more valuable in recent years as a way of bringing the best content to the surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Github/Looking at code</strong> - Sometimes the best way to learn is to go straight to the source.  We live in a golden age of open source software, where billions of lines of code are available for anyone to look at online.  Code is ultimately the source of truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Forums, Mailing Lists &#x26; Chat Groups</strong> - Many technologies, geographic areas and interest groups have vibrant online communities that can be a great source of learning.  In the past these groups tended to exist as mailing groups, IRC channels or forum sites.  But nowadays the most popular form of community seems to be chat groups implemented with Slack or Discord.</li>\n<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - These aren’t something that most of us can do regularly, but conferences are a great place to be introduced to new ideas and make connections with people in a tech community.</li>\n<li><strong>Meetup Groups</strong> - A more accessible option than conferences for many people, most mid-sized and larger cities have multiple tech meetup groups that can be a good place to grow a tech community and be introduced to new concepts</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregators</strong> - Aggregator sites like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> are useful places to encounter new ideas.  Compared to the options above, they’re much noisier; you’ll encounter a mix of content quality and topics.  But it can be a great way to find serendipitous ideas and find new blogs, podcasts and communities to follow.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - Social Media sites (especially Twitter) can be a great way to get a sense of whats on a tech communities collective mind, and encounter concepts and ideas while they’re still being formed.  But it also can be a distracting mess of noise.  So consider moderating your intake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d generally recommend a mix of the resources above, though you’ll find some are more helpful to you than others I personally have found that books, blogs, newsletters, wikis and aggregators have been the most useful for me personally, as well as finding ways to teach others through meetup groups, conferences and my own blog.  There is real truth in the idea that the best way to learn something well is to teach it.</p>\n<h3>Specific Resources</h3>\n<p>So the above stuff is all pretty generic.  I’ll end by listing some resources that I’ve found personally helpful in learning and keeping up with the JavaScript and React world.  This isn’t exhaustive, and I know there are a lot of great resources out there that I haven’t personally used.  But this is my list:</p>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix\">JavaScript Allongé</a> is a great ebook about functional JavaScript.  It was very influential for me in terms of how I structure my code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TTXlZt\">Effective JavaScript</a> is a bit dated now; it was written pre-ES6.  But it’s the best non-beginner book I’ve read about the JavaScript language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GNviXY\">Clean Architecture</a> is my favorite book on Software Architecture.  If you want to think about how we structure programs at a higher level, it is worth a read</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GPi6ll\">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> is a book I’ve mentioned a few times recently here; Its my new recommendation for a first “writing better code” book because its so concise.  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TRAPAl\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> played that role for me personally though, and I’d still recommend it as well for any developer who hasn’t read it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Atomic Design</a> is a great book on building modern design systems, and has been useful for me as I think about how to break down UIs in my development work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Video Courses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/\">Egghead.io</a> is the best source for dev video content I’ve found.  Video has never really been my jam, I prefer text content where I can go through it at my pace and easily reference back and forth between it and code.  But it can be great to get a focused intro to a topic, and Egghead seems to have nailed the format with its collection of short focused snippets. It’s mostly a paid service, but there is a bunch of great free content on there, especially beginner React stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Wikis</h4>\n<p>These are maybe stupid obvious, but I’ve learned more from these 3 sites than probably anything else listed here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> is the single best source for software development information on the internet.  Note that I would advise most people to use it as more of a googleable resource than a place to ask questions; they’re focused on documenting canonical answers to common problems moreso than chasing down situational issues, and for popular technologies they are fairly comprehensive.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN</a> is my site of choice for learning about browser APIs and JavaScript/CSS/HTML language features.  It’s extremely reliable, and generally very readable (although some articles are much more detailed than others).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> is a surprisingly great place to learn about general computer science concepts.  I wouldn’t use it for front end specific stuff, there are better resources there, but if I want to learn about a classical computer science concept like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue\">priority queue</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a> wikipedia usually has a pretty robust article giving the basic background.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Blogs</h4>\n<p>For blogs, I highly recommend getting a good RSS reader so you can keep up with posts as they come.  My tool of choice here is <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/\">Feedbin</a> for which I pay a very small monthly fee, but there are good free alternatives like <a href=\"/https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2ality.com/\">2ality</a> is a blog focused on new JavaScript features as they work their way through the TC39 development process.  It’s the best resource I know of for understanding what is coming down the language pipeline, and also learning about new features when they are released.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">Overreacted</a> is Dan Abramov’s “Advanced React” blog.  It’s the best single source of knowledge on React that I’ve seen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> is more of a mega-blog, with multiple articles published a day by a variety of authors.  It’s consistently high quality content, and even though it leans more towards “web site development” than “web app development” there is stuff here that anyone will find interesting.  It’s also been around a long time and has great historical resources for learning newish CSS standards like CSS Grid and Flexbox.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/\">The official React Blog</a> is excellent and a great place to get “official news” about React.  The same applies for other frameworks like Ember, Vue, and Angular; you always want to be following the official source and not just getting your news from the community.  It greatly reduces the chances of misunderstanding and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming\">cargo culting</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org\">benmccormick.org</a>.  Ok I’m sort of kidding here, but the truth is that having my own blog has been one of the best ways for me to learn; I learn when I write, I can reference back to older posts when I’m re-engaging with a topic, and things stick better when you write them down.  Plus when I write posts like this where I’m linking other resources, its easier for me to find those resources later. (but uh… feel free to tell everyone to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/subscribe\">subscribe</a> to my blog anyway)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Newsletter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a> is a great “list of links” style newsletter every week.  If you just want a pulse of the weekly news in the JS community, I think this is the best place to find it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/subscribe/\">Kent C Dodds’ Newsletter</a> is a great resource for React and JavaScript testing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">Hacker Newsletter</a> is a roundup of the top <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> posts each week.  Hacker News can be a bit of a mess (the comments are often written from deep within the startup bubble and the quality of links at any given time on the site is mixed) but it’s an amazing source of interesting content if you’re willing to wade through it.  This newsletter lets somebody else do that for you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://this-week-in-react.org/\">This week in React</a> is another source of advanced React content.  It’s actually just a summary of the interesting things going on in the React repo itself.  So if you’re interested in contributing to React or want to see how they’re progressing against their roadmap, it’s an interesting and quick read each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Aggregators &#x26; Social Media</h4>\n<p>Honestly, 2 years ago I probably would have led with this section; Twitter and Hacker News were a huge part of how I have found interesting content and built my skills over the past 5 years.  But I’ve gotten disenchanted with them over time as they became part of a broader issue of my increasing inability to focus on things because of the abundance of technology related distractions in my life.  So… caveat emptor.  That said here are some people I’d recommend following on Twitter if you’re interested in React and JavaScript.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>React</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\">Kent C Dodds</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\">Ryan Florence</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acemarke\">Mark Erikson</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">Shawn Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rauchg\">Guillermo Rauch</a></li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyleet\">Tracy Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_developit\">Jason Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slicknet\">Nicholas Zakas</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A final note</h3>\n<p>I just want to end where I started, and encourage you to not rush out and try to absorb all of these things at once, but instead work on projects and find the resources that give you what you need.  And then explore a bit on the side to help yourself grow.  Your resources will probably be different than mine.  The internet is huge, the world is even bigger. Explore and have fun!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js"}}}],"topic":"career"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
