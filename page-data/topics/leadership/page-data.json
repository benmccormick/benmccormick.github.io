Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.  Behind door number #1 lies a relatively rapid path to a “senior developer” role, followed by stagnation the rest of your career as you reimplement the same solutions in new technologies for minimally increasing pay over time, until youth-friendly tech culture decides that you’re too old to be useful.  Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 145.51495016611295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/40f08/twtl.png 143w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/d4502/twtl.png 285w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/8e7b9/twtl.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"ten-things-js,jest-git,orthogonality-css-js","topics":["management","leadership"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"favorite-interview","title":"My Favorite Interview Question","description":"How does the Internet work anyway?","layout":"post","path":"/2017/07/24/my-favorite-interview-question/","date":"2017-07-24T11:45:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I have a favorite question to ask in interviews for web developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How does the internet work?  In other words, when I open a browser and enter a url then hit enter, and a website shows up on my screen what can you tell me about what is happening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usually I get one of a few responses:</p>\n<h4>1. The clueless shrug</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uh….  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have no idea what to do with the question.  Things get awkward. This is mostly for junior positions but still isn’t the best sign.  Sometimes a few prods will get things back on track.</p>\n<h4>2. The bare minimum</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is asking a server for the site and the server sends you the site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people can give a very basic response, but don’t give a lot of details.  This again mostly corresponds to less experienced devs and can be fine as a starting spot with some follow-up questions.</p>\n<h4>3. The CliffNotes</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your browser sends an HTTP request which gets routed through a local modem/router and gets sent to a name server for its url extension.  That name server routes the request to the correct IP address, which will resolve to some sort of web server.  That server will serve up either some static files, or run some backend code in order to generate a resource (probably an html page).  When the HTML page is returned, your browser will parse it, which will likely generate more requests, and the cycle will repeat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people know how some of this works, maybe with a few hazy areas and can explain it in a reasonably straightforward way.  An explanation like this is a great start.</p>\n<h4>4. The Geek-out</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><Some variation on the previous answer... followed by:> Let me tell you all about my in depth knowledge of &#x3C;HTTP<em>network routing</em>JavaScript parsing/TCP/other related topic></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people dive in and explode with information.</p>\n<h3>So why is this a good interview question again?</h3>\n<p>So which answer is best?  The geek-out right?  Well… its great when somebody gets there, but in my mind this question is more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to make the case that this is a pretty bad interview question.  It’s not clear what the expected answer is.  When I ask it in junior dev interviews, they often don’t have much of a clue how to answer it.  And it’s not strictly answerable in full detail by pretty much anyone.  But I’d argue that those things actually end up being strengths.  I like this question for 5 reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the candidate’s ability to deal with ambiguity.</strong>  The question is intentionally vague and open ended.  Am I just looking for a perfunctory response like “it gets a resource from a server”?  Do I want a deep dive into how DNS works?  It’s ambiguous.  Candidates can respond to that ambiguity in one of a few ways.</p>\n<p>They can freeze because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>They can ask a clarifying question.</p>\n<p>They can make a guess at what I want and start going down that road, while reading my reaction to see if they’re still on track.</p>\n<p>Or they can decide they know what I want (or what they want to tell me) and shoot off like a rocket (potentially for a very long time).</p>\n<p>This is super useful information in an interview because developers deal with ambiguity all the time.  When a candidate encounters unclear requirements from a product manager, or unclear documentation from another developer, it’s good to have an idea how they’ll respond<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the breadth of a candidates knowledge.</strong> - For the most part, when I interview people, I ask them questions about the role they’re applying for:  Front-End Dev, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, etc.  But this question gives a candidate the chance to show that they understand what’s happening up and down the web stack from the code they interact with the most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate a chance to explain a complex technical topic.</strong> - In my mind, good communication ability is the most important skill for a developer once they’ve achieved a minimum level of technical competence.  Being able to talk about problems and solutions clearly and explain them to a variety of audiences matters, and it matters a lot.  Can the candidate summarize a complex technical topic without getting bogged down in details?  Are they communicating with me (verbally or otherwise) to make sure I’m following their explanation?  Or are they fading off into a rambling run-on explanation of a trivial detail without any big picture context?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It forces the candidate to confront something they don’t know.</strong> - The internet is a perfect example of the Isaac Newton quote about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants\">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>.  It is the culmination of 50+ years of research and work on networked computer systems.  No candidate I interview for a web development position is going to understand every detail of how it works, because you can always go a layer deeper in the stack or afield into crazier edge case behavior.  So at some point in questioning (possibly very early), this question exhausts every candidate’s knowledge.  The question is how do they react?  Some candidates start guessing at things.  Some admit they don’t know.  Some try to skirt around areas they don’t feel confident in and work at avoiding any questions where they would have to admit they don’t know something.  And some will actually ask me how part of the system works.  This again is helpful because “not knowing the answer” is such a common experience in real world web dev.  It’s great to have some clues to how a candidate handles that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate an opportunity to show off what they know.</strong>  I’ve gotten some amazing answers to this question.  It turns out some candidates actually know a lot about networking and HTTP/TCP/nameservers.  Some can give detailed answers about browsers and how they parse resources and display the DOM.  Maybe they just know a lot of random trivia about URLs and DNS.  Regardless, this is a chance to show off and prove that they’ve delved deep into something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think every interview question should be like this one.  Most should probably directly relate to the work the candidate is doing, be clearly comparable in an objective way candidate to candidate, and not risk sending the interview down a 10 minute rabbit hole.  But this one is my favorite, and I think there’s a place for questions that show how a candidate might handle some real world lack of structure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick\">@_benmccormick</a> to tell me your favorite interview question.

Here’s a small sample of buzzwords, trends and methodology that are concerned with reducing the time between making a change to software and seeing the results:</p>\n<p><strong>Agile -</strong> Agile is all about delivering working software sooner, so that you produce value faster and learn lessons quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD) -</strong> Test driven development is a process designed to let you know as soon as possible when a change has had the desired effect during development, and also sets up the conditions under which you know as soon as possible when a change has had an undesirable side effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Devops -</strong> Devops has been a push over the past decade to automate and control all parts of the software creation, deployment and maintenance life cycle.  Automation like continuous integration servers that run your test after every commit, chat bots that alert you based on site performance metrics, and servers that automatically build a copy of every branch for testing in a virtual machine are all examples of Devops being used to speed up the point when you know that a change worked or didn’t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Experience -</strong> This is a more recent buzzword that I’ve seen thrown around a lot in the JavaScript community, talking about improving developer tools.  Developer tool features like hot reloading, nicer error messages, specialized debugging and profiling tools, and fast build times all fight this same problem of getting a result as fast as possible.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Loops</h3>\n<p>All of these tools are concerned with <em>feedback loops</em>, the process by which developers, designers and product managers make changes, learn about the effect of those changes, and then iterate.  Teams with slow feedback loops spend a lot of time planning and thinking about every change, making sure to get everything right. They feel the cost distinctly each time they make a mistake, and it generally leads to a more cautious mindset.  Teams with fast feedback loops can plan too.  But they also have the option of taking a more experimental attitude and learning from their attempts. This can happen at multiple scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>developer</strong> can try out 5 different CSS rules in the UI in a few seconds if his UI is hot reloading and he doesn’t have to wait for a whole SCSS bundle to recompile</li>\n<li>A <strong>QA team</strong> can immediately know if somebody pushes a change that would breaks tests if they have a CI server set up to run tests against every new commit to each branch.</li>\n<li>A <strong>product team</strong> can see quickly that a new feature is problematic if he’s able to see detailed analytics on usage, instead of waiting to do enough user interviews to get a full picture</li>\n<li>A <strong>company</strong> can change direction if they ship an MVP early instead of attempting to wait and release the perfect product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Your Loops</h3>\n<p>As a developer who wants to make your product better, one of your best power moves is finding ways to speed up feedback loops.  Here are 4 suggestions for how to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions Early:</strong> One of the most important feedback loops for a developer is between yourself and the individual in charge of defining what you’re building.  If you simply take requirements from your PM/Manager/Lead/Designer/CEO/Client and go off and build your giant amazing piece of beautiful software, without any clarification, there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get to build it again, this time twice as fast without the budget.  Asking clarifying questions early prevents you wasting your time and exposes understanding gaps and technical barriers while there’s still a chance to deal with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Feedback as you go:</strong> Similarly, anytime you have a chance to get feedback on work while it is still in process from somebody who might object in the end, do it.  This means instead of building everything at once, work on smaller chunks.  This often takes time and thought, but the earlier you create <em>complete</em> chunks of code that can be evaluated and ideally shipped on their own, the more likely you are to ship something great in the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your environment:</strong> Have you spent time figuring out how to work as efficiently as possible?  Have you done it recently?  If not it might be worth re-evaluating your setup on a quarterly basis or so, figuring out what tools you can use to get quicker feedback, and also learning the shortcuts, tricks and new features for the tools that you do use.</li>\n<li><strong>Ship Code:</strong> Ultimately the best feedback comes when people are using what you’ve written.  Whether that’s compliments, bug reports, feature requests, anger or viral adoption, shipping will tell you things that you would never have been certain of while iterating on your own.  If you’re struggling to get code out, always fix that first.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"book-review-five-dysfunctions,philosophy-of-software-design-book,radical-candor-book","topics":["leadership","management"],"category":"reviews","key":"management-path-review","title":"Book Review: The Manager's Path","description":"A wonderfully detailed look at the career path for leadership-focused engineers","layout":"review","path":"/2019/06/12/book-review-the-managers-path","date":"2019/06/12","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Titles in the software engineering world are strange.  Without much work, it’s easy to find <em>Senior Engineers</em> with 2 years of professional experience, <em>junior developer</em> job descriptions requesting 5 years of experience, <em>tech lead</em> roles focused purely on technology, <em>tech lead</em> roles where the lead is managing a team, and who can tell the difference between a <em>CTO</em> and a <em>VP of Engineering</em> anyway?  This results in weird title shifts when developers switch jobs, odd or unfair salary distributions, and a world where it is very difficult to understand what a career path looks like in this industry.</p>\n<p>Camille Fournier’s book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p\">The Manager’s Path</a> steps into this breach by laying out a clear look at an engineering management-focused career path. The book runs through a series of roles: <em>Mentor</em> to <em>Tech Lead</em> to <em>Manager</em> to <em>Manager of Managers</em> all the way up to <em>Executive</em>. For each role she describes what the job is,  walks through what type of challenges you might face in the role after a promotion, and offers practical advice on overcoming those challenges.</p>\n<p>I found it to be an extremely engaging read, and the best description of what it actually looks like to advance in technical leadership roles I’ve ever read.  Because she focuses on skills and responsibilities more than titles, it’s possible to apply her advice across large and small companies, even those with wonky title structures.  It helped me think about what skills I need to be building in my career, and gave me a glimpse of what next steps look like.</p>\n<p>The focus on common challenges and how to face them was also helpful, though whole books could (and have) been written on those challenges and how to face them at each level.  The Manager’s Path serves as a good starting point here, identifying the challenges and giving good solid general advice for facing them.  For those new to a role it could help them identify where they’re weak or uncomfortable, and serve as a starting point to a deeper dive into those areas.</p>\n<p>As I read the book, I immediately thought of 4 or 5 people at various points in their career I knew who could benefit greatly from reading this book.  If you’re working in the software world and think that you long term are interested in advancing in your career beyond your current role, there will probably be interesting tidbits in here for you.  Even those who are sure they <strong>don’t</strong> want to be in management could benefit from understanding the perspectives of what engineering managers actually <em>do</em>.  The book is also structured so that the first few chapters are highly relevant for both technical and manager track developers; tech lead is an important role on both tracks.

Some of this is macro level; Where do we split chunks of related functionality into different files?  Some of it is micro level; what should the rules be for when we use an inline function instead of pulling it out into its own named method?  Some of it is trivial; Do we use <code class=\"language-text\">_</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> to separate words in file names?  In our current codebase we’re not always consistent on many of these issues.  As we’ve discussed the various issues, I realized that some of them bothered me more than others, and (more interestingly to me) my ideas have changed here over time.</p>\n<h3>The Platonic Ideal</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p> In a perfectly consistent system, 3 developers writing the same module would produce line by line identical code</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s an extreme point of view out there that says “while a perfectly consistent system might not be possible, the closer we can get to that the better”.  The benefits of consistency are many: consistent naming helps with code search and connecting different parts of a system.  Consistent code structure makes code easier to scan once a developer is familiar with the system, and it makes exceptions stand out as something intentional and interesting.  Consistent formatting removes potential distractions.   So what’s not to love?  Shouldn’t we always try to add more consistency?  I see 2 primary reasons why it might not be worth trying to enforce every single rule we can come up with.</p>\n<h4>We’re only human</h4>\n<p>The first reason not to enforce “everything” is that our human attention spans can only internalize so many rules at once.  When we’re trying to remember a large number of rules, its easy to miss one.  But more importantly, when we’re writing code or reviewing it, focusing too much on human enforced consistency rules can distract from the actual purpose of the code, making it harder to notice the substance of code because we’re so focused on the form.</p>\n<h4>Standards too soon</h4>\n<p>The other thing that can happen when you try to standardize everything is a loss of creativity.  Sometimes it’s helpful to experiment for a while to find the right pattern in a codebase.  In an ideal situation experiments like that will happen on the side, or be explored in branches, but for small teams or new codebases, it will likely happen at least partially in production.</p>\n<h3>User Friendly Consistency</h3>\n<p>So what <strong>can</strong> we do to get the benefits of consistency? The 4 ways I like to see this happen are:</p>\n<h4>Automation</h4>\n<p>The best way to enforce stylistic consistency and other straightforward things like naming conventions is to use automation.  Linters like <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> and auto-formatters like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>.  My rule here is that any linter rule that is about stylistic consistency should be auto-fixable, if not it isn’t clear enough or isn’t worth it.  For “correctness rules” it can be ok to flag errors without auto-fixing, if human judgement is needed.</p>\n<h4>Code Review Checklists</h4>\n<p>Code reviews can be a good way to limitedly enforce consistency; but its good to limit scope to avoid <a href=\"https://samsaccone.com/posts/code-reviews-not-nits.html\">developers trying to become human compilers</a>.  If you try to enforce too many things in code reviews, its easy for people to get caught up in going through a list and forget to apply human judgement to the context of the current code. But <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews\">code review checklists</a> are a good way to make a coordinated push on high value items that are either new or often neglected.  This checklist should consist of a few important things to check during every review. The list should be re-examined on a regular basis and ideally kept to 5 or less items.</p>\n<h4>Focused Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Sometimes its appropriate to have “refactoring initiatives” to standardize on a particular pattern over time.  This can be good for standardizing on a particular library for a task, or removing an older pattern that persists in the codebase after a better way has been found.  My advice here is to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/\">only do one of these at a time, and complete them before starting a new one</a>.  One of the biggest causes of inconsistency is when a team attempts to ”<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">standardize</a>” on a solution, then abandons that for a new solution without finish the migration, resulting in a <a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html\">lava layer architecture</a>.</p>\n<h4>Focus on the high level</h4>\n<p>If there is one place to apply human consistency checks its at the structural level.  If your high level patterns are consistent, the code base will be easy to navigate, and modular code written in a standardized high level structure will be <a href=\"https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to\">easy to delete</a>.  Overall low level code that is inconsistent or poorly written is easier to overcome than high level code as long as you’re taking advantage of code reviews and the other methods suggested here to improve new code, because most low level code is only read occasionally.  So high traffic “messy code” can be a focus of refactoring efforts, and the rest can continue working without disturbing anything.</p>\n<p>Messy code is much more problematic at a structural level though, because when different areas of the code are arranged in different ways, it becomes much harder to find functionality when debugging.  This type of inconsistency also tends to make bulk improvements harder, as you have to have a much greater understanding of all the ways a codebase is put together.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/01/consistency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"soft-skills,radical-candor-book,obvious-things","topics":["leadership","management"],"category":"eng-management","key":"herding-lions","title":"Herding Lions","description":"Creating change starts with respect","layout":"post","path":"/2019/05/27/herding-lions","date":"2019/05/27","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I used to find myself using the term “herding cats” a lot when confronting inertia, disorganization or ambiguity in work situations.  <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=herding%20cats\">Urban Dictionary</a> actually endorses this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The phrase herding cats comes from the common saying that something involving coordination of many different groups or people is as difficult as herding cats.

This isn’t a moral statement.  I’ve done and enjoyed both.  Working with a distributed team requires a different set of skills, especially when you’re a leader.  Today I want to share the most helpful lessons I’ve learned over the last year managing a distributed team.</p>\n<h4>Evaluate process and outcomes, not inputs</h4>\n<p>Focusing on output` is great advice for any team, but it’s easier and more important when managing remote teams.  When you’re not in the office with people, you won’t see when they start in the morning or finish at night.  You won’t be able to tell if they’re taking long coffee breaks or checking Amazon between tasks.  You’ll have to evaluate them on their output and on the methods they use to get work done.</p>\n<p>Evaluating on outputs is tricky for tech work in the short term.  It’s often hard to tell how hard a specific task should have been.  But over the long run, you’ll need to find ways to see if developers are meeting their goals, and focus on that over the exact times they did work.  And this is good, because that is actually what matters.</p>\n<p>Output is a lagging indicator though.  In the short term, what you can evaluate if “butts in seats” isn’t an option.  I recommend process: is work being documented, are tests being written and are code reviews being done in a timely manner?  The nice thing about this is that you can check these things in low touch ways; by reviewing your issue tracking and version control systems rather than having status meetings or sending distracting slack messages.  This idea comes up in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XBg1iv\">Camille Fournier’s book The Manager’s Path</a>, where she argues persuasively for always doing your information gathering in ways that don’t disrupt your team first.</p>\n<h4>1-1s are extra important</h4>\n<p>Let’s say Sarah has some lingering concerns about her current project that she’s not yet ready to raise to the full group.  When I work in the same office with Sarah, she can drop by my desk anytime to talk through a small issue.  When we’re working remotely, that may not feel as comfortable for a variety of reasons.  Good 1-1s provide space for the little things to come out.</p>\n<h4>When you get in-person time, focus on the relationship</h4>\n<p>Currently I get together with my team (and my manager) about once a quarter.  Initially my instinct was to save the “big work stuff” for that time.  And I still try to get a few big conversations in each time, mostly around career development.  But the most value from these visits has come in the gaps, when I go out to lunch with my team and chat, or we get together with a larger group after work.  Time spent together builds trust, and that trust lingers and pays off when you’re back on the other side of the internet the next week.</p>\n<h4>Async communication is great.  Don’t neglect “face to face” time.</h4>\n<p>“Embrace async communication” is common remote work advice.  When you get stuff done through email/slack/Github/Invision/etc you have fewer meetings and more flow time for your team.  Which is great!  My team takes advantage of “async” tools every day.  But I also try to be intentional about working in “face to face” time through Zoom.  For my team that’s a daily standup and weekly 1-1s, but it could be different for another team’s process.  The key is to not <em>only</em> rely on writing.  Writing is an amazing way to communicate, but it will always lack the context of the human face.  For now I’m aiming for a mix of mostly async with regular “internet face to face”, and occasional “in person”.</p>\n<p>Make sure to personalize your communication as well.  If Jerry tends to miss all nuance when you communicate in text, try to spend more time talking over zoom to make sure you’re communicating.  On the other hand if Jennifer has a tendency to lose track of what you’re asking her to do, you may want to give instructions through a text medium, where you can use it for accountability later.</p>\n<h4>Hire for remote success</h4>\n<p>Not everyone is going to thrive in a remote role.  Most companies hiring remote recognize this and try to filter for it in some form. A lot of companies’ response here is to “only hire senior”.  Which is probably a workable heuristic in some ways.  Developers that have a proven track record of success probably have built up some habits that will help them succeed in remote work even if they aren’t naturally inclined to it.  But hiring only senior folks is expensive, and makes things like diversity and career growth paths harder.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done this enough to draw any hard conclusions on remote hiring yet.  But the qualities I want to evaluate for are independence, technological comfort, writing skills, and a history of taking the initiative to seize opportunities (in whatever domain).  Obviously that’s in addition to normal hiring criteria.</p>\n<h4>Tools and Process matter</h4>\n<p>The worst way to work remote is to not commit to it.  Commitment means aligning your process toward remote work.  Some lessons here.</p>\n<p><strong>First, Hybrid meetings are harmful to your team</strong>.  There are 3 ways to do meetings: in person, remote, or hybrid.  An in person meeting involves putting a number of humans in a small room for an hour and letting them talk through an issue.  A remote meeting connects various people from the comforts of whatever work venue they’ve chosen, and discussion ensues over the internet.  In a hybrid meeting, some people are in the room, and some are connecting remotely.  Hybrid meetings are hell for the remote folks.  Usually they can’t hear at least one person well.  They can’t match faces to voices, lose context of what is happening in the room, and are sometimes just plain ignored by the folks in the room.</p>\n<p>I really didn’t understand how bad this was until I did it myself a few times.  If you’re a leader who uses or tolerates hybrid meetings, I highly recommend trying to call into them remotely a few times.  As the boss you’ll get a slightly different experience, but ask yourself: are you a first class meeting participant when you’re calling in remote?  If not, is it acceptable to you to treat your remote workers as second class participants?</p>\n<p><strong>Second, Use good tools</strong>.  Bad collaboration software is a drag if you’re working with people in person.  It’s a killer for remote teams.  Use software that lets you communicate in timely and useful ways, keep your project critical information organized, and lets your team focus on getting stuff done.  There are hundreds of good tools out there these days, so there’s no excuse for using bad ones.  My recommendations, which are not particularly controversial and also not the only good options: use Zoom for video chat, Slack for messaging, Bitbucket, GitHub, or Gitlab for Version Control, Trello or Jira<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> for task tracking depending on the size of your team, and Google Drive for keeping documents and documentation together<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I… don’t love Jira.

This is what people talk about when they say something is “hard earned experience” I guess.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples from my career:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>In the long run, rate of improvement (or regression) matters more than current level</strong> - This has applications in hiring, code quality, and finding/staying in a job.  But it’s often easier to observe how good something is now than to see how its changing, and I often fail to properly estimate what a trend means for a situation 1-3 years down the road.  It’s also easy to mis-apply this principle when you for get about the “long run” part.  A new employee with tons of potential won’t help you when you need an experienced hand <em>now</em> and fixing technical debt can easily cost you your ability to hit a quarterly objective.  Knowing how to balance these long and short term goals is something I still struggle with all the time.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewriting from scratch is (almost) never worth it</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/\">Joel Spoelsky</a> wrote about this way back in 2000 and I remember reading that article nearly a decade ago and nodding along.  I seem to have infinite capacity to convince myself that my current situation fits in those parentheses though.  In my career this has mostly been a problem where I’m able to more accurately forecast the pain that would ensue from fixing what exists (because that code exists and is easier to work with), while I appear to systematically underestimate the pain of building the new thing (because the internet told me it would be great, and the code doesn’t exist for me to nitpick yet).</li>\n<li><strong>Always consider multiple options</strong> - Pretty much any decision (technical or otherwise) benefits from having multiple contenders.  This seems obvious.  But I have often let myself fall into situations where I’m choosing between just 2 options, or really just choosing whether or not to do 1 thing.  This has applications in technology choices, job choices, responding to another person’s provocations, and more.  I intuitively know that more options are good, and I constantly miss opportunities to add options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how do we improve on these situations where we fail to apply <em>obvious</em> wisdom?  I’ve been learning a few things lately.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Always review what you’ve done on a regular basis</strong> - Do weekly reviews about how your week went.  Do quarterly reviews with yourself about how your job is going.  When you make big decisions, make sure to find a time to check back in later and evaluate how it went.  We make better decisions when we take the time to measure our results</li>\n<li><strong>Note Missed Opportunities</strong> - When you do those reviews, make sure to pay attention to when you missed an opportunity to apply something you <em>knew</em>.  Sometimes we make mistakes because we just didn’t know something.  It’s more common though that we didn’t properly apply our own principles and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify Cues</strong> - Identify the thing that you know you’re going to have to handle different next time.  Maybe you say “if I’m looking for a job, I should consider at least 4 or 5 different companies and not focus in on just one”, or if I’m asked to fix a legacy codebase, I will spend at least 3 months trying to improve it before considering a re-write,and I’ll look for real world comparisons to base a rewrite estimate on”.  Whatever it is for you, when you can identify situations where a specific action should take place, it can help you be better the next time instead of repeating the same old mistakes.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"radical-candor-book,clean-architecture-book,tech-leads-book","topics":["leadership","book review","management"],"category":"reviews","key":"resilient-management-book","title":"Book Review: Resilient Management","description":"A great collection of management wisdom","layout":"review","path":"/2019/07/22/book-review-resilient-management","date":"2019/07/22","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management\">Resilient Management</a> by Lara Hogan is a short and useful read for engineering managers who want to think more systematically about how they support their team.

She’s an assistant professor who teaches writing to college students, and has found that her students pursuing technical degrees generally fail to see the value in learning to write.  The contrast between their expectations and my perspective after a decade working in software was strong.  I promised her at the time that I’d write down some thoughts on why writing skills are valuable for software engineers.  So here it is, 6 reasons that writing skills are crucial for working in the tech industry<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h4>1. You will write every day</h4>\n<p>Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside.  One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.  Here are a few types of writing that I’ve done daily or weekly for the last decade:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussing technical implementations through chat apps like slack</li>\n<li>Writing Bug Reports</li>\n<li>Writing comments in my code and technical documentation to help others and my future self understand what was done</li>\n<li>Writing reviews of other developers code to help our team improve and coordinate on best practices</li>\n<li>Answering questions from less technical employees or clients, often through email or slack.</li>\n<li>Creating design documents for complex work during planning times</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That list is illustrative but not exhaustive.  Any software engineer who wishes to build software that is used by others will end up doing plenty of writing.</p>\n<h4>2. The ability to explain complex topics will set you apart</h4>\n<p>The ability to take a complex topic and explain it in terms that somebody who doesn’t have all the background you do can understand is a critical one for software engineers.  This can help negate two of the most frustrating experiences for a developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A business asking for work that doesn’t make sense because the business folks don’t understand how the product works</li>\n<li>Less experienced members of the the team routinely making mistakes and breaking things because they don’t understand how the product works</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Senior engineers who can explain and document complex pieces of software save everyone frustration by helping junior members of the team understand how things work and be more productive, and by aligning business expectations and plans to the reality of how their software systems actually work.  These are hugely valuable activities that can make a big difference in your career.</p>\n<h4>3. Writing will help you find a (better) job</h4>\n<p>When I’ve interviewed software engineers, I see a variety of problems: they fail to present their strengths, don’t manage to show a sincere interest in the job, and get caught flat-footed on fairly standard questions.  Most of these mistakes come down to a lack of preparation, not tailoring their message to their audience, and not knowing how to structure the information they know about themselves in a compelling way.  These are the skills that you’ll learn from a good class on writing, and develop through practice writing.</p>\n<p>Interviews are important, especially early on in your career.  Your compensation as you go throughout your career tends to be anchored to where you started, especially if you stay one place for a long time.  An increase of $5,000 in salary on a job you take today would mean an additional $92,000 of accumulated income over the next 15 years assuming a salary increase rate of 3% a year<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition if you write publicly on a blog like this, it can help you show proof of your knowledge in a way that a resume never will.  Not everybody needs to be publicly blogging, but if that appeals to you it can be a great career booster.</p>\n<h4>4. Remote work increases the importance of writing</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest trends in the tech industry these days is the <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/remote-workforce-rise/\">rise of remote work</a>. More teams are embracing partial remote work, and there are major companies like Buffer, Invision and GitLab that are entirely remote.  Remote work is partially enabled by video chat technology, but written communication is the lifeblood of a successful remote team. Collaborating via tools like Slack, Github, Trello and Jira is part of most teams’ workflows, but when everybody is remote, being able to express yourself clearly on these platforms is critical.</p>\n<h4>5. Your career trajectory will depend on your ability to influence and persuade</h4>\n<p>Most developers when they begin their first software job will be given a set of tasks to do and the expectation is that they will create work to the spec that somebody else has designed.  They are implementors.  But as a developers career progresses there is an opportunity to be more than an implementor.  Since developers understand the system best, they often have ideas that can help shape product designs.  Developers also often need to work with other teams whose goals may not be completely aligned with their team.  These are not situations where even a senior engineer is likely to have direct authority.  Instead the developers who continue to grow in their careers are those who are able to influence and persuade without authority.</p>\n<p>This is again a skill that writing classes can cultivate.  Persuasive writing practice can help give you the clarity of thought and intuition for structuring arguments that will help both when you’re trying to make a point through writing or doing it verbally.</p>\n<h4>6. Writing skills translate to writing code</h4>\n<p>This last one is really specific to software engineering, but I’ve found that applying writing principles to code has helped me write more maintainable code.  Most code written in a professional context will be read many times by other people (or by the original author after they have long lost track of their original context).  Being able to write code that can be understood by both a computer and by human beings is a skill developed over time, but many of the same “brain muscles” that you develop in writing prose can be applied to code: it’s important to know your audience, structure your information in a logical manner, and use judgement when finding just the right phrase (or code structure) for a situation.

But it’s important to be aware of the other styles/approaches available in your leadership toolbox. A strong leader understands that different styles can be valuable when an environment or situation calls for it. As Herminia Ibarra says in my <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\">favorite article</a> on this subject, “Small changes—in the way we carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact—often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup/\">Taste The Soup | Rands</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a meeting where an individual or team is presenting a complex idea or project, my job as the leader is soup tasting. It’s sampling critical parts of the idea to get a sense of how this soup has been or will be made. Who are the critical people? What are the critical parts? Which decisions matter? I don’t know. I do believe that a pre-requisite for leadership is that you have experience. You’ve had trials which have resulted in both impressive successes and majestic failures. These aggregate lessons define your metaphoric soup tasting ability, and when your team brings you a topic to review, it is this experience you apply to ask the critical soup questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/\">Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder | Charity Majors</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you like engineering management, your tendency is to go “cool, now I’m a manager”, and move from job to job as an engineering manager, managing team after team of engineers.  But this is a trap.  It is not a sound long term plan.  It leads too many people off to a place they never wanted to end up: technically sidelined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lethain.com/values-oasis/\">Trapped in a Values Oasis | Will Larson</a>  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>  The rule of thumb here is to lead through ambiguity, and advocate through disagreement.\nIt’s important to diagnose your situation correctly, because when you get it wrong, it’ll still feel like you’re making progress, but it’s wholly dependent on you and it’s progress that is likely to come at the cost of undermining both you and your team within the broader organization. It can be extraordinarily frustrating to “disagree and commit” to a policy or value that goes against your personal values, but any worthwhile measure of successful leadership needs to consider your team’s success more highly than your own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://kellanem.com/notes/friday-wins\">Friday Wins &#x26; A Case Study in Ritual Design | Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Culture is what you celebrate.

You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. You don’t want that person or the rest of the team to think you’re a jerk. Plus, you’ve been told since you learned to talk, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Now all of a sudden it’s your job to say it.

You can see this in project estimation, where engineers often resist providing any estimate since “it’s hard to tell before we actually build it”.  You can see it in product planning, where teams I’ve worked with struggle to provide clear usage or business impact goals since “it is hard to tell how impactful this will be till we build it”.  </p>\n<p>Hubbard’s advice for making properly calibrated estimates would probably help in multiple places in the software world:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use 90% confidence intervals when there’s uncertainty, not point estimates or vague categories like “medium risk”</strong> - Saying a piece of software work is “large” is much less actionable and informative than “we’re 90% confident that it will take between 3 and 15 days to complete.  </li>\n<li><strong>Use absurd scenarios and alternative bets to calibrate a confidence interval</strong> - You may think you have no idea how long a novel new software project will take, but even for projects with high uncertainty this is untrue.  You can start by asking questions like “is there any chance this will be done tomorrow” and “is there any chance this project will take more than 5 years”.  If the answer is no, then you’ve established a baseline confidence interval, and you can start working inward from there.  When you get to the point that something is feasible if unlikely, its a sign that you’re probably near the 90% confidence interval<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  Once you have a starting place, you can further consider a hypothetical bet where you had to choose between a lottery with a 90% payout of $1000 and a scenario where you got the $1000 when the item ended in your range.  If you would clearly prefer one of those scenarios to the other, your range is probably too tight or too loose.</li>\n<li><strong>Model your estimates with simple monte carlo simulations</strong> - Hubbard recommends using Monte Carlo simulations (picking random numbers according to the distributions set up by your confidence intervals ~1000 times) in order to get a better intuition of what real world outcomes might look like.  Doing this right does mean understanding not just the confidence range, but also what the distribution looks like.  Estimating simple software feature work for instance, is likely not a normal distribution.  Many tasks will be straightforward and be completed quickly, but we’ll hit occasional tasks that require significant restructuring of a program to complete.  It’s a classic “long tail” scenario.</li>\n<li><strong>Break down estimates into component parts</strong> - One of the most powerful techniques for making better estimates under uncertainty is “Fermi Decomposition”, the process of breaking an estimation problem into smaller estimation problems (which may be more tractable) and then combining the estimate.  In software this can mean breaking up a large project into the component pieces of work and then estimating those.  Doing this right of course means capturing our uncertainty on the sub-estimates, so that we can roll that up into the larger estimate.  If we optimistically point estimate every element of a project, we’re going to end up with a total estimate that is actually less likely, since we need <em>everything</em> to go well to hit that total estimate.  I commonly see engineers handle this by doing optimistic estimates and then adding a buffer period.  It would be better to be clear about uncertainty and do your decompositions with a range of values (although it does make sense to factor in uncertainty about tasks that may be missing).  </li>\n<li><strong>Consider what measurements will be valuable</strong> - When we start viewing our estimation goal as reducing uncertainty rather than eliminating it, its easier to see that some easy measurements might go a long way toward improving our projections, even if they won’t take us to an exact value.  For instance if we want to know how many tickets we might close during an upcoming sprint, it can be easy to say that there’s no way to know.  The new work is unique and isn’t necessarily directly comparable to work we’ve done in the past.  However just because we can’t make an exact projection doesn’t mean we know nothing.  If we look at our last 10 sprints and see how many tasks we completed in each of them, we can feel confident that this upcoming sprint is likely to be between the minimum and maximum value in that range, or at least close.  If we’re currently planning like we will accomplish something outside of that range, this could be very useful information.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this definitely has me thinking about the good and bad of software estimation, and how I might incorporate this into my team’s rhythms.  Would love to hear stories of effective estimation processes in software.

When I first went through this sheet, I circled over 40 words as values that “resonated” with me.  They’re things that I value and strive for, or wish that I was more like.  Deciding between adventurousness and cowardice is not a “values decision”. A real values decision means that you’re trying to decide whether good traits like adventurousness, belonging, or clear-mindedness are more important to you.</p>\n<p>Management often forces you to choose between goods: Will we ship quicker? Aim for higher quality? How do those choices impact work/life balance for our teams?. It’s hard to know if we’re making good choices, because the results routinely lack clarity.  Indicators lag, causation is fuzzy, and we don’t get to compare to a control group.  Values can be guideposts through ambiguity.  I’ve seen the power of this at a company level in my current gig, where having a set of values that are kept in the spotlight often allows us to weaponize them as decision making tools <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Going through the list, I eventually cut things down to 20, 12, 10 and then 8.  That still feels like a lot to me, but for each of the 8 I can easily cite work situations I’ve faced in the past month where my response came directly out that value.  In the end I ended up with <em>Integrity</em>, <em>Thankfulness</em>, <em>Community</em>, <em>Prudence</em> (in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence\">classical sense</a>), <em>Generosity</em>, <em>Continual Improvement</em>, <em>Accountability</em>, <em>Justice</em>.

It leads to <strong>inspiration</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wow I’m looking at web development in a whole new way now.  This really changes how I think about my job!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea how to give a talk that inspires people.  But after speaking a decent amount over the last few years, I’ve figured out what helps me give talks that can inform most people, and avoid having people leave bored or enraged.  I want to share what I know, because the truth is that giving a talk at a conference or meetup can be fun and rewarding, and I would love it if you too got the chance to enjoy that.  So here are my tips:</p>\n<h2>The Pitch</h2>\n<h4>1. Show up!</h4>\n<p>The only way to give a talk that will interest and inform other people is to actually attempt it.  If you live in a place that has meetups, those are often the easiest place to start.  They’re usually run by 1 or 2 people who are going to be grateful to find new folks who are willing to speak. Depending on format, you may be able to give a 5 or 15 minute talk along with other speakers at a meetup to ease into things.  If there’s no meetup, you can also apply to conferences.  Almost all conferences have open “Call for Papers” periods where they invite applications, and many of them try to save some spots for new speakers.  Conference speaking is more of a crapshoot though, since they often have many applications for few spots, and your best bet is to apply widely, and possibly suggest several different talk ideas.  This year I applied to speak at 6 conferences, and actually spoke at 2, and that was by far my best ratio since I started applying to speak a few years ago.</p>\n<h4>2. Pick a topic that you’re interested in</h4>\n<p>Giving a talk can be a fun experience, but it can also be frustrating for both you and the audience.  The best way to suck all of the joy out it is to give a talk about something that you don’t care about.  If you’re uninterested in the topic, the work to prepare is either going to be a painful grind, or you won’t do it.  In which case sitting through your talk may well be a painful grind for your audience.</p>\n<p>Note that I don’t say to pick a topic you’re passionate about.  Not every talk is going to be the pinnacle of your speaking career, and sometimes there may be nothing out there that is currently changing your life.  You can really help people by sharing the useful, interesting information you have, and this doesn’t need to be more than that.</p>\n<h4>3. Pick an audience for whom that topic is relevant</h4>\n<p>So you have a talk topic, and that’s great, but does your topic make sense for the people you’re speaking to?  Sometimes when you start speaking you may pick a topic before you’re sure where you’re going to give the talk, other times you may have a place you want to speak, and you need to pick a topic for it.  Either way, make sure that you end up with a topic and an audience that match.  If you’re talking to a group of beginner web programmers, a deep dive into the Rust memory model might not be the best choice.  If you’re speaking to veteran python programmers, a talk about the basics of object oriented programming might miss its mark.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may not know your audience exactly.  This is especially true for speaking at large multi-track conferences, where there may be developers (and/or non-developers) from a variety of backgrounds.  In this case, you’ll still want to pick the audience you want to target (some subset of the group you know may be there), and then make sure to do a good job of following point #6 below.</p>\n<h4>4. Pick a “main takeaway” for your audience</h4>\n<p>It’s not enough to just have a topic and audience that generally match.  You’re also going to want to know what you want the audience to get out of it.  Talking about “debugging” to a JavaScript audience could be a good talk, but do you want them to learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to use Chrome devtools to find performance bugs?</li>\n<li>a repeatable step by step workflow for figuring out any bug?</li>\n<li>a story about how you solved a specific bug?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike the “topic”, the takeaway should be pretty specific.  Given the audience that you’re targeting, what piece(s) of new information do you want them to receive as they walk away from your talk?</p>\n<h4>5. Pick a talk format</h4>\n<p>There are a few main formats that most tech talks fall into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present a problem, describe several possible solutions (possibly recommending one)</li>\n<li>Present a tool, explain what problems it solves and give examples of using it</li>\n<li>Present an idea or way of looking at things, and show how it applies in different situations</li>\n<li>Tell your story. Explain how a certain technology, idea, or problem in the tech community has affected your life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these formats can work, for a first talk I’d recommend one of the first 2, keeping things concrete and making it easier to get to that “main takeaway”.</p>\n<h4>6. Write a description that tells your audience what to expect</h4>\n<p>The final step of putting together a pitch is writing a description that accurately lets attendees know what to expect.  A great title and description do a few things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You actually have something to submit to a meetup organizer or a conferences call for papers.</li>\n<li>A good description helps ground you as you prepare the content of the talk.  You can look at your slides and see if you’re actually focusing on the things you wanted to communicate<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>A well written title and description will help attract your target audience to your talk.  If you’re giving a talk for beginners or advanced users, or users of a particular technology, make sure that’s clear in the description.  People go out of their way to go to talks where they know they’re the target audience, and nothing kills the mood of a talk than a situation where the talk isn’t relevant to most of the audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in general, a good description matters more than the exact title of the talk, but if you’re at a multi-track conference, make sure to give a descriptive title, as conferences will often only include the talk name in their schedules, without a top-level description.  Naming your talk about the creative uses of Golang “Go-ing Crazy” is fine for a Go meetup, but if people are going to be choosing what session to attend based on your talks name, something more descriptive would be nice, even if it has a little less personality.</p>\n<h2>The Preparation</h2>\n<h4>7. Have slides</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some amazing live-coding talks.  I’ve given one myself at a meetup.  There is definitely a place for them, as well as for minimally visual talks with 2-3 slides.  But if you’re aiming for informative, structuring your talk around a good slide deck is your best bet.</p>\n<p>Slides shouldn’t have too much information: they’re the backbone of your talk, and aren’t meant to stand alone<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  Instead, they provide structure both for you and the audience as you move through your presentation.</p>\n<h4>8. Have a talk track</h4>\n<p>Slides are good, but they’re just the start.  You need a talk track that is more than just “reading off my slides”.  To feel really well prepared for a talk, I usually write out a complete script for the talk that I intend to follow, and then edit that after several practice run throughs.  For the actual talk I usually boil most of that script down to bullet points to keep me focused.  There will be some experimentation needed there to figure out what works best for you.</p>\n<h4>9. Make sure your A/V setup works!</h4>\n<p>I was reminded just last week about the importance of testing that you can give your talk in the venue you’re speaking at with the equipment you have as early as possible.  I was forced to give a talk last week on my manager’s laptop after mine failed to connect to the venue’s projector.  It ended up being a dumb problem on my side that I could have solved if I’d verified my setup earlier and had more time to figure things out.  So that’s my a/v setup parable.  The things to remember here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show up early and test your setup if at all possible (event organizers are usually happy to help with this and may insist on this)</li>\n<li>Bring your own adapters.  In the US, at least be ready to connect to HDMI and VGA.  I can’t speak to what might be common internationally, but at the very least it’s good to be paranoid</li>\n<li>Make sure to bring a power cable.  Your slides going black in the middle of your talk is not a good look.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Delivery</h2>\n<h4>10. Have notes</h4>\n<p>So now it is time to actually give your talk.  Make sure to bring notes.  Most presentation software programs like Powerpoint and Keynote have nice built in presenter note features for this (make sure to practice setting it up so that you see the notes and the audience just sees the slide). You also can just use paper notes in a notebook. Notes are important to keep you on track in case you freeze, and may be something you just want to read for portions of the talk.</p>\n<p>Here again you have several choices for how to handle notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can read your talk from a script. This lowers your ability to connect with your audience, but it is low risk, and you’ll guarantee that you’ll hit the content you intend to.  As a native english speaker, I probably underrate this a bit too.  If you’re presenting in a second language and reading can help you confidently deliver the material, it may be worth doing so.</li>\n<li>You can work off of bullet point notes, which were ideally pulled out of a full script that you wrote originally.  So you’re talking naturally, with some notes to give you structure and help pull you back in if you’re fumbling around.</li>\n<li>You can memorize your talk verbatim.  This is hard and high risk (if you forget something it can become an awkward stumble as you try to get back to your script), but has a chance at being a very compelling experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have found that bullet point notes work well for me, but if you’re great at memorizing things, or would be more comfortable reading and are ok with sacrificing some connection to the audience, all 3 can work.</p>\n<h4>11. Give context and set expectations (again)</h4>\n<p>At the start of your talk, you want to answer 3 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are you?</li>\n<li>Who is this for?</li>\n<li>What are you going to be talking about?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may think you answered these questions with your description, but there will definitely be people at your talk who didn’t read your description, and others who misread it.  Giving context at the beginning of your talk helps people prepare to hear the things that matter in your talk.  If this is a conference, it lets people decide whether they want to stay for your talk or not.  Don’t be discouraged if some people walk out of your talk after your explanation.  That’s a sign that you’ve done a good job clarifying the scope of your talk, and honoring their time. Having those folks leave now will be a much better experience than having them staring at Facebook and distracting others through out your talk, and it is now more likely that the people in front of you are the audience you wanted to address.</p>\n<h4>12. Be Confident and Grateful</h4>\n<p>When you know your topic and you’ve prepared well, the actual speaking part will usually end up being the easiest part.  So be confident.  Not because you’re already a great speaker, or because of some feeling of baseless optimism, but because you’ve done the work to be ready and you have the structure around you to succeed.  Also make sure to be grateful.  A bunch of people showed up to hear you speak.  Appreciate them, give them your best and hopefully try to answer their questions.  Speaking is a great opportunity, and I hope you get the chance to try it.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rands has a <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/archives/out-loud/\">great post</a> on preparing for a presentation.

It seemed generally applicable, so here’s a cleaned up version of what I shared.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What Is Value?</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to think of software engineering work as a series of task where you’re given instructions and you make the computer do what the designer / PM / CEO asked.  Or as a series of fun problem solving challenges that you’re somehow getting paid to complete.  Both of those views will eventually lead you to make suboptimal decisions when it comes to helping your business and growing in your role though.  Instead consider the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software Developers create value through shipping working code that solves important user problems in a predictable manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This captures a number of important things.</p>\n<h3>Shipping</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real Artists Ship - <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineer’s super power compared to other roles is that we get to build.  We create new things, add new behaviors, and ultimately (for a product company) control the shape of the product our company is built around.  This only has value when software actually ships though.  When we’re not shipping, it’s actually worse than just being slow to deliver value, because of a few non-obvious factors.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>unshipped code rots.</strong>  When we leave code in a branch 90% done, it doesn’t just stay the same.  It’s quite common for our situation to get worse.  Our teammates check in code that may cause merge conflicts, or worse just doesn’t take into account the unshipped code and sets us up for subtle bugs.  And when we do get back to the work we’ve often lost valuable mental context that makes any remaining work or testing harder and more error-prone.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we learn from shipping!</strong>  It’s quite common in software development for a developer or team to complete 90% of their feature according to the spec, only to find that they have another 90% of the work to go.  Doing the work to push things through to production inherently de-risks things, because we learn what the challenges are, and we know how long the work took.  Up until then, we will always have unknowns.  And when software goes out to users, we get to hear their feedback as well.  Shipped software lets us learn from our users (and from the performance of our system) and make adjustments that we wouldn’t have known about if we sat on the code.  </p>\n<p>So how do we get to shipping?  First, it’s important to push things through to completion rather than allowing ourselves to jump from project to project, making progress without finishing, and incurring a lot of cost from context switching.  Soemtimes this may mean imposing kanban style <a href=\"https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/\">work in progress limits</a> on ourselves.  Second, its often helpful to break things into smaller chunks.  Small code reviews are easier to complete, test, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/22/better-code-feedback\">review</a> and verify.  So multiple small changes will often go through faster than the same changes bundled together into a big chunk.  This can go too far, but as long as your changes work in isolation and provide value, I’d encourage erring on this side when in doubt.</p>\n<h3>Working Code</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[We Prefer] working software over comprehensive documentation - <em>The Agile Manifesto</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software engineers are responsible for their code working.  At the simplest level that means delivering code that doesn’t crash when run in the intended way.  As we grow and mature as developers however, we should aspire to  learn to write code that will scale to any reasonable load the system might see (and maybe even to unreasonable loads), code that handles odd input or context gracefully, and code that is easy to modify and maintain.  We should also take responsibility for proving that it works; writing tests, making the code easy to monitor in production, and providing good logging for debugging all fall under a software engineer’s domain. We also should make sure that our definition of working matches what the business needs, not just a pedantic reading of whatever spec we’re working off of.  More on that in a moment.</p>\n<h3>Solving Important User Problems</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just really funny- What the Customer Wanted expanded <a href=\"https://t.co/kdr7HKTSDy\">pic.twitter.com/kdr7HKTSDy</a></p>&mdash; Frank Spillers (@farreaching) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/farreaching/status/764256002053025792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineers can be quite inventive in the ways they write code without solving important user problems.  Some common routes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working on their own pet projects over the prioritized business problems</strong> - Tech improvement work and engineer-driven projects are part of a healthy organization, but if they consistently replace work that was scoped based on user requests / feedback, they can cause problems</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec without solving the original problem</strong> - This is partially a design/product problem, but its often possible to meet all the stated requirements for a project without solving the original user pain point.  Great engineers understand exactly what problem they’re trying to solve with a feature and will always step back to evaluate whether they’re succeeding throughout the development process.</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec and causing new problems</strong> - Oftentimes our efforts to fix cause or expose new problems.  When we dodge responsibility by ignoring or hiding those problems instead of openly evaluating tradeoffs or working to improve the solution, we’re not providing all the value we’re capable of. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are ultimately issues of ownership. When we’re invested in our work, we will want to work on useful problems and make sure they produce real value.  If you’re consistently not feeling that way, it may be time to find something else to work on.</p>\n<h3>In a predictable manner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources - <em>Fred Brooks</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, now we come to the section that is the <em>boring part</em> for many software engineers.  But as somebody who has recently converted to the management side of the fence, the ability to ship predictably is incredibly important.  </p>\n<p>It’s important for software engineers to ship predictably in 2 senses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of when something is likely to ship among the people who need to know</li>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of how something will work when it will ship among the people who need to know.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Estimating software engineering projects is not an exact science. Nobody reasonable expects estimation perfection from software engineers, especially those new to the field.  Instead we aim to be as accurate as possible, and especially to be transparent as those estimates change over time.  </p>\n<p>When we encounter obstacles, it’s important to be realistic about what they mean to schedules and update the important people in a timely manner. </p>\n<p>For those working on a product team that may be a manager and a PM, for those building something solo, that may be the customers or internal users of the software directly.  It’s never fun to say something is going to be late, but its always better to say that we’ll miss a date that is 2 weeks away than to tell somebody for the first time that you’ve missed the date that was 2 days ago.</p>\n<p>Communicating about the scope of work is just as important as schedule.  If we find out a piece of a feature is unfeasable or we dropped it due to time pressure, its important to communicate that.  Depending on your team/product, that may mean sharing with people directly, updating documentation, or just making the new behavior clear in an interface.   </p>\n<h3>It’s a process</h3>\n<p>Nobody starts out their first software engineering job with a fully evolved sense of how to estimate, scope and document their work.  Most have no clue how to think about building a system to be scalable or when to escalate problems to other members of the team.  These are skills learned through hard experience.  Make sure to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/05/18/obvious-things\">always be reflecting</a> on what you’re experiencing though.  Experience combined with reflection is a powerful mixture, and eventually will lead to growth.

It’s been an interesting experience, and because this is a fairly common way to transition into engineering management<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, I thought it might be worthwhile to share some lessons I’ve learned so far.</p>\n<h4>1. Time discipline is key</h4>\n<p>The biggest challenge of this transition was learning to be a manager.  It’s a whole new job!  But the biggest challenge specific to the management/developer split has been managing my time.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit loose with my time management.  I do a lot based on my mental state at a particular time; if I’m tired or uninspired I may lean more into grunt work like documentation, code reviews, or more “scripted” code work.  If I’m in the zone I’ll dive into big tasks, and if someone comes to me with a problem I tend to context shift into it and go from there.</p>\n<p>This “time management strategy” hasn’t held up at all while trying to balance manager and development strategies.  Basically because of the blend of <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">maker and manager schedules</a>.  Developers need long uninterrupted periods of time to be productive, while managers tend to operate on a much more social and interrupt driven schedule.  They’re naturally opposed.</p>\n<p>Working with this tension requires discipline and planning.  For me personally I’ve started planning my schedule for the next day at the end of the previous day, batching my checking of Slack/email and being more thoughtful when somebody asks for my time.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning my schedule for the next day</strong> is a tip I picked up from <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work</a>.  To close out the day, I review the things I’ll need to handle the next day, and block out my calendar with time for different tasks for the next day.  This does mean that my calendar <em>always looks completely booked for the current day</em>.  So far this has served as a feature not a bug; I can still move things if something urgent comes up and it has a way of encouraging people to schedule less urgent things in advance.  Note that scheduling like this doesn’t mean you can’t change plans; I do all the time.  It just means that you start with a plan and can be thoughtful about how you vary off of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Batching Slack and email</strong> has been something I’ve known would be good for me forever.  It feels good in the moment to be the guy who is constantly available, but the cost of distraction is higher than you think.  So far, management has been a catalyst for me buckling down here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I get a lot more unexpected requests for my time now than I did previously.  I’ve found that batching my email and Slack reading combined with <strong>a willingness to suggest a meeting later in the day or the next morning rather than <em>right now</em></strong> has helped me protect blocks of productivity and focus, without making me an unresponsive manager.  Most things can sit for 2 hours without blowing up anyone’s day.  The key is to ask enough to identify the 5% of things that can’t wait.</p>\n<p>Those 3 tactics have worked for me, but overall it comes down to being intentional about your time.  If you let yourself be blown by the wind while splitting dual responsibilities, one of them will almost always receive the short end of the stick.</p>\n<h4>2. Team success metrics are the only ones that matter</h4>\n<p>When you’re acting as both a developer and a manager, it can be tempting to hold yourselves to 2 sets of metrics: management metrics and development metrics.  This is a mistake.  It will cause you to over-prioritize your own tasks and hurt your team’s long term growth.</p>\n<p>Focusing on personal development metrics and goals can lead to over-prioritizing them for a few reasons. First, development goals tend to be much “cleaner” than management goals; it’s easier to tell what you’ve achieved.  Second, if you’re transitioning into this role from a dev role, you probably are much more comfortable with these tasks, and so they can act as a safe place where you avoid having to stretch yourself.  And finally, if you moved into this role from a senior dev position, it can be easy to tell yourself that this is actually the best way to get stuff done.  And you may be right… in the short term.</p>\n<p>So what’s the antidote?  Focus on team productivity and view your own work as just an extra card you have to play in your hand.  It’s an advantage you have over less technical managers, but if you don’t set to working developing other strengths, you’re not going to be able to grow, and if you’re monopolizing the important work your team won’t be able to step up into new roles.  So play that card, but do it with caution, and always as a means rather than an end.</p>\n<h4>3. This isn’t long term sustainable; have a plan</h4>\n<p>Hybrid Management / Developer roles aren’t a long term game.  Aside from the scheduling tension I mentioned above, once you move into this role you’re either going to be slowly giving up responsibilities and watching your tech skills slowly move off the cutting edge as you focus on learning how to manager your team and developing others to fill the roles you once did, or you’re going to be failing as a manager as you try to cling too tightly to your senior individual contributor responsibilities.  So if you want to avoid that, it’s important to be evaluating how you want your career to evolve.  A role like this can be a first step up a chain, or part of a <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">dev to manager pendulum</a>.  You also might discover that management isn’t for you and decide to move back.  I’m committed to this for a set period of time, and that’s helped me to work through the days when I wonder what I actually accomplished, and think strategically about what I need to get better at.</p>\n<h4>4. Best Management resources</h4>\n<p>So this isn’t a learning so much, but as a newbie manager, probably the best thing I can do is point you to the resources I’ve found helpful.  So here are some of the best.</p>\n<p><strong>On Engineering Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/\">Rands In Repose</a> by Michael Lopp and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Clyjvy\">the book he pulled out of the blog</a> are great little snippets of engineering management gold</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=1f50ce22f02ed0ffc80c10aff&#x26;id=8c0f947e69\">Lara Hogan’s Newsletter</a> is full of useful advice, and she’s really good about including exercises to help practice what she’s describing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>On Management Generally</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F4i0ni\">Radical Candor</a> is the single most helpful thing I’ve read while trying to figure out this whole management thing</li>\n<li>Patrick Lencioni’s books are all told as “leadership fables” which can seem a bit weird, but in the squishy imprecise world of management, stories can be very effective ways to teach.

It explicitly focused on the set of technical skills that you need to become a “senior” JavaScript developer.  While I’m happy with that post, I’ve always wanted to revisit the idea, because it is my strong belief that <em>once you’ve hit a minimum level of technical capability, only about 20% of career success is determined by your technical skills</em>.  The other 80% is composed of skills that can be loosely bundled under “soft skills”.</p>\n<p>You may quibble with my choice of percentage, but I don’t think the underlying idea that things other than technical ability is particularly controversial.  Even if they bitterly dismiss such things as “politics” most developers are aware that their careers are impacted by things that go beyond their ability to write algorithms.  What I haven’t seen much of however, are attempts to catalogue what these soft skills are, and how somebody might get better at them.  The second part is outside of the scope of a single post, though I will attempt to list resources here.  But the first is achievable, and that is what I will attempt to do here.</p>\n<p>The following is not an exhaustive list, but it covers 10 “soft skills” that I’ve seen have a clear impact on my career in software and those of others.  The best part? These are things you can grow in that will have an impact in your life outside of work, and in any career you might transition into in the future.</p>\n<h3>The Skills</h3>\n<h4>1. Clear Communication</h4>\n<p>While I’m making bold statements: A developer’s ability to communicate clearly is the single most important skill in determining the trajectory of their career.  Poor communicators are forced to rely on others to interpret their work, even when it is brilliant.  They will often create problems for others through miscommunications or lead teams to make suboptimal decisions because they were not able to explain the technical considerations involved in a situation.</p>\n<p>Great communicators on the other hand, enlighten.  They help teams understand what is really going on so that non-technical team members can make good decisions, and technical folk can work with confidence.  Great communicators cut through misunderstandings, expose ambiguity and poor assumptions, and can translate for team members who are having trouble making themselves heard.</p>\n<p>Communication skills are important for those on a management track, but they are just as important for those on a technical trajectory. Architects, Principal Engineers and Tech Leads must coordinate with many teams, teach less experienced developers, explain technical tradeoffs and document decisions and code.  Those are core parts of a senior technical employee’s job, and all of them come down to communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing\">The Importance Of Writing For Software Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codingame.com/blog/10-tips-to-improve-your-communication-skills-as-a-software-developer/\">10 Tips to Improve your Communication Skills as a Software Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Attention Management</h4>\n<p>This one is more commonly referred to as “time management”, but I agree with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">this recent NYT Op-Ed</a>: the mechanics of how we organize our time is less important than whether we end up spending it on the most important things.  This broadly encompasses the ability to prioritize, to prevent distractions from wreaking havoc on productivity, and the ability to find ways to get back on track when things go wrong or priorities change.</p>\n<p>This was a weakness for me early in my career: I got things done but often did them haphazardly or inefficiently.  One of my biggest sources of growth in the last few years has been finding ways to structure and prioritize my time better, while cutting out distractions.  This has been necessary due to life changes: I’m now a parent and have people reporting to me at work.  I wouldn’t be able to meet my current responsibilities with the habits I had as a 25 year old.  For me this has been largely about focusing in on a small amount of essential things and actively removing less important things from my life.  For others it may be more about establishing patterns and limits.  Either way, this requires planning and introspection first to be effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR\">Deep Work - Cal Newport</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scheduling-every-minute-of-my-day/\">Scheduling Every Minute of My Day - Brad Frost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">Productivity Isn’t About Time Management, It’s about Attention Management - Adam Grant</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Initiative</h4>\n<p>If you see an opportunity or a problem, do you do something about it?  I’ve been reading a good amount of “manager books” recently, and in many of them a surprising amount of focus is dedicated to the question of how we create conditions when people are “empowered” to act.  And there certainly is an environmental factor here.  People are more likely to take initiative and risks when they’re not afraid of being punished for it.  But the individual also controls a lot here.  Developers who are willing to step up and take initiative in a situation can make an outsize impact.</p>\n<p>Do you have a piece of code or process on your team that everybody acknowledges is a bit wonky, but nobody has ever taken the time to fix even though it is slowly taking a toll on the team over time?  Are there simple things that you know could make your product better, but nobody has quite taken the time to get to them?  Those are the opportunities that initiative can turn into value.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/fix-like-no-ones-watching/\">Fix Like No One’s Watching</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Empathy</h4>\n<p>There is no meaningful software product that has been created in isolation.  One person may have written the code (though that is quite rare for software with any scale of impact), and maybe even didn’t collaborate with anyone to handle distribution / hosting etc, but if that software is used by others there is always support, training and marketing to consider.  You can create a todo app for yourself without talking to anyone.  But nobody makes a career in this business without talking to other humans.</p>\n<p>The thing about us humans; we work well with people who we trust, and who we perceive as caring about us.  We also are for the most part exceptionally good at discerning when somebody is faking it.  So if we can’t get away from humans, and we can’t be fake, what can we do?  We are left with, in the words of Dale Carnegie “becoming genuinely interested in other people”.  If you’re currently filled with red-faced frustration at your annoying co-worker or manipulative boss, this may seem like asking for a miracle. And arguably any time we look outside ourselves it is a miracle. But regardless of your philosophical outlook on such things, there are definitely ways we can improve in how we work with and care for the people around us.  And it starts with trying to empathize and seeing the people around us as human beings and not obstacles or tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iiooe4\">How To Win Friends And Influence People - Dale Carnegie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YSZasy\">Radical Candor - Kimball Scott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WVkqfv\">I Hear You - Michael Sorenson</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5. Negotiation &#x26; Persuasion</h4>\n<p>You may not think that Software Engineering involves much negotiation.  But that is only true if you use a shallow definition of negotiation.  Every time a team debates implementation strategies for a feature, which tickets should end up in a sprint, and how much time to spend chasing a difficult to reproduce bug, they are engaging in negotiation, and team members are attempting to persuade.  And there is a wealth of knowledge out there describing how to improve on these skills.</p>\n<p>A word of caution here; unlike some of the other things on this list, these skills can often be dangerous when they’re improved in isolation.  When developers complain about politics trumping technical ability, they’re often experiencing decisions being made based on the ability of some employees to persuade and negotiate.  When those employees are not actually providing the best ideas this is suboptimal.  For the technically skilled employees, the answer is to learn to persuade better.  But for those who can negotiate we always need to make sure that we’re <strong>persuading for good</strong>.  Just like the loudest voices shouldn’t always win, when you can communicate well, make sure to stay humble and  boost other’s good ideas when you see them.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OUBnnl\">Negotiation Genius - Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6. Continual Learning</h4>\n<p>Were you paying attention in high school physics when they taught about the difference between distance, velocity, and acceleration?  Distance is the amount an object has traveled.  Velocity is the speed at which it is currently moving in a given direction.  Acceleration is the rate at which the object’s velocity is changing.  If you want to know where an object is <em>right now</em>, distance is the only thing that matters.  But as time progresses, velocity starts to matter more, and in the very long term any difference in acceleration will be the only thing that matters.</p>\n<p>The same ideas play out when acquiring skills.  If you need to evaluate your career potential for the next few months, the skills and accomplishments you’ve acquired so far (distance) are the only things that matter.  But if you want to think about your career potential over the next 30 years, the new skills you’re acquiring (velocity) and even more importantly your ability to get better at learning new things (acceleration) will matter much much more. Learning is a skill unto itself, and the earlier you invest in it the more dividends it will pay over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/\">Learning To Learn - Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js\">How To Keep Learning JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>7. Self Care</h4>\n<p>Another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way in my career is the reality of my own mortality.  None of us are indestructible, and our bodies are not perpetual energy machines.  They require care and maintenance.  Our souls too are not meant to run on work alone, and we can burn out hard without sufficient rest.  This is all aside from deeper issues of disease and mental health that can change our lives in even more profound and difficult ways.</p>\n<p>Self care is a career skill because frankly we are great at deluding ourselves into thinking we’re functioning normally while we’ve compromised ourselves.  <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2014/07/you-might-not-know-if-youre-sleep-deprived.html\">Research</a> shows that we are horrible judges of whether our judgement and creativity are compromised by lack of sleep.  Because we can’t run controlled studies on ourselves, we don’t really know whether our lack of exercise or 60 hour workweek induced burnout are hurting our creativity.  But research suggests it is for pretty much everybody.</p>\n<p>Healthy socialization, sleeping, eating and exercise ultimately lead to better emotional stability, ability to focus, and creativity.  But even aside from the career benefits, when we’re devouring our bodies and minds for work, it leads to a question of what we’re doing this for in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OVBpvx\">Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work &#x26; The Common Rule</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>8. Business Awareness</h4>\n<p>Do you know what your company actually does?  Do you understand why the features you’re building are important, and the relative priority of them?  Can you explain the business tradeoffs involved when you’re making an software architecture decision between performance and security?</p>\n<p>In companies larger than a few people it’s not ultimately developers’ jobs to make business decisions.  But understanding the context for those decisions helps us better prioritize our time, make good tradeoffs, and call attention to inefficiencies or counterproductive behavior in our products. In addition, nobody wants to spend time working on things that don’t matter. But when we try to innovate without understanding the broader business, we often end up doing just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology\">Choose Boring Technology - Dan McKinley</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>9. Marketing and Branding</h4>\n<p>Marketing is a dirty word in engineering circles.  Many take the attitude of the Dilbert comics that <a href=\"https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-05-02\">marketing is a synonym for exaggeration lying, and fraud</a>.  But at it’s core marketing is just making sure that the people who could benefit from your services are aware of those services.  This has several applications to developers.  In the job market, finding ways to let employers know who you are and what you’re capable of is important.  But in medium to large companies it also is important to do some level of internal marketing; to make sure you’re credited for the work you’ve done and that people understand it’s values.  Developers who consider themselves above this or dismiss it as politics do so at their own peril.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/single-post/2019/02/17/7-Common-Content-Marketing-Mistakes-Developers-Make-and-How-to-Avoid-Them\">7 Common Content Marketing Mistakes Developers Make and How to Avoid Them - Stephanie Morillo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>10. Character</h4>\n<p>The final item here is in some ways an oddball.  While the other 9 things on this list are skills that you can work on, character is something deeper.  Questions of what good character is and how you develop it are way outside the scope of this post.  And I would personally consider any attempt to improve your character for solely utilitarian career reasons to be ultimately hollow.  But character is undeniably important in your career.</p>\n<p>Do the people around you trust you?  Do they believe that you’re trying to do the right thing?  If the answers are no, you may find obstacles in the most unexpected places.  If the answers are yes, you will eventually find help from people you would never have looked to.</p>\n<p>In addition, as an industry, technology has the power to shape the world, and as practitioners we all get the chance to impact our little corners of the world.  It’s worth considering not just whether we’re “succeeding in our career”, but what impact we’re having on the world around us.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I5jP7K\">Future Ethics - Cennydd Bowles</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/15/soft-skills"}}}],"topic":"leadership"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
