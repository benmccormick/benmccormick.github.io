Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.  Behind door number #1 lies a relatively rapid path to a “senior developer” role, followed by stagnation the rest of your career as you reimplement the same solutions in new technologies for minimally increasing pay over time, until youth-friendly tech culture decides that you’re too old to be useful.  Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 301px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/fb933/twtl.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 145.45454545454547%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        src=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/fb933/twtl.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/a6b04/twtl.png 143w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/0e2fe/twtl.png 285w,\n/static/d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce/fb933/twtl.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"ten-things-js,favorite-interview,jest-matchers-1","topics":["career","leadership"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"adequate-talk","title":"How To Give A Perfectly Adequate Conference Talk","description":"Tips for making your talk both useful and rewarding","layout":"post","path":"/2017/10/29/adequate-talks/","date":"2017-10-30T02:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Tech talks at conferences or meetups generally end up being experienced in one of 4 ways by audience members.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s a disaster, and that leads to <strong>rage</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This person is not just wasting my time, I don’t even understand what he’s trying to tell me.

It leads to <strong>inspiration</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wow I’m looking at web development in a whole new way now.  This really changes how I think about my job!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea how to give a talk that inspires people.  But after speaking a decent amount over the last few years, I’ve figured out what helps me give talks that can inform most people, and avoid having people leave bored or enraged.  I want to share what I know, because the truth is that giving a talk at a conference or meetup can be fun and rewarding, and I would love it if you too got the chance to enjoy that.  So here are my tips:</p>\n<h2>The Pitch</h2>\n<h4>1. Show up!</h4>\n<p>The only way to give a talk that will interest and inform other people is to actually attempt it.  If you live in a place that has meetups, those are often the easiest place to start.  They’re usually run by 1 or 2 people who are going to be grateful to find new folks who are willing to speak. Depending on format, you may be able to give a 5 or 15 minute talk along with other speakers at a meetup to ease into things.  If there’s no meetup, you can also apply to conferences.  Almost all conferences have open “Call for Papers” periods where they invite applications, and many of them try to save some spots for new speakers.  Conference speaking is more of a crapshoot though, since they often have many applications for few spots, and your best bet is to apply widely, and possibly suggest several different talk ideas.  This year I applied to speak at 6 conferences, and actually spoke at 2, and that was by far my best ratio since I started applying to speak a few years ago.</p>\n<h4>2. Pick a topic that you’re interested in</h4>\n<p>Giving a talk can be a fun experience, but it can also be frustrating for both you and the audience.  The best way to suck all of the joy out it is to give a talk about something that you don’t care about.  If you’re uninterested in the topic, the work to prepare is either going to be a painful grind, or you won’t do it.  In which case sitting through your talk may well be a painful grind for your audience.</p>\n<p>Note that I don’t say to pick a topic you’re passionate about.  Not every talk is going to be the pinnacle of your speaking career, and sometimes there may be nothing out there that is currently changing your life.  You can really help people by sharing the useful, interesting information you have, and this doesn’t need to be more than that.</p>\n<h4>3. Pick an audience for whom that topic is relevant</h4>\n<p>So you have a talk topic, and that’s great, but does your topic make sense for the people you’re speaking to?  Sometimes when you start speaking you may pick a topic before you’re sure where you’re going to give the talk, other times you may have a place you want to speak, and you need to pick a topic for it.  Either way, make sure that you end up with a topic and an audience that match.  If you’re talking to a group of beginner web programmers, a deep dive into the Rust memory model might not be the best choice.  If you’re speaking to veteran python programmers, a talk about the basics of object oriented programming might miss its mark.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may not know your audience exactly.  This is especially true for speaking at large multi-track conferences, where there may be developers (and/or non-developers) from a variety of backgrounds.  In this case, you’ll still want to pick the audience you want to target (some subset of the group you know may be there), and then make sure to do a good job of following point #6 below.</p>\n<h4>4. Pick a “main takeaway” for your audience</h4>\n<p>It’s not enough to just have a topic and audience that generally match.  You’re also going to want to know what you want the audience to get out of it.  Talking about “debugging” to a JavaScript audience could be a good talk, but do you want them to learn</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to use Chrome devtools to find performance bugs?</li>\n<li>a repeatable step by step workflow for figuring out any bug?</li>\n<li>a story about how you solved a specific bug?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike the “topic”, the takeaway should be pretty specific.  Given the audience that you’re targeting, what piece(s) of new information do you want them to receive as they walk away from your talk?</p>\n<h4>5. Pick a talk format</h4>\n<p>There are a few main formats that most tech talks fall into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present a problem, describe several possible solutions (possibly recommending one)</li>\n<li>Present a tool, explain what problems it solves and give examples of using it</li>\n<li>Present an idea or way of looking at things, and show how it applies in different situations</li>\n<li>Tell your story. Explain how a certain technology, idea, or problem in the tech community has affected your life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these formats can work, for a first talk I’d recommend one of the first 2, keeping things concrete and making it easier to get to that “main takeaway”.</p>\n<h4>6. Write a description that tells your audience what to expect</h4>\n<p>The final step of putting together a pitch is writing a description that accurately lets attendees know what to expect.  A great title and description do a few things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You actually have something to submit to a meetup organizer or a conferences call for papers.</li>\n<li>A good description helps ground you as you prepare the content of the talk.  You can look at your slides and see if you’re actually focusing on the things you wanted to communicate<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>A well written title and description will help attract your target audience to your talk.  If you’re giving a talk for beginners or advanced users, or users of a particular technology, make sure that’s clear in the description.  People go out of their way to go to talks where they know they’re the target audience, and nothing kills the mood of a talk than a situation where the talk isn’t relevant to most of the audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in general, a good description matters more than the exact title of the talk, but if you’re at a multi-track conference, make sure to give a descriptive title, as conferences will often only include the talk name in their schedules, without a top-level description.  Naming your talk about the creative uses of Golang “Go-ing Crazy” is fine for a Go meetup, but if people are going to be choosing what session to attend based on your talks name, something more descriptive would be nice, even if it has a little less personality.</p>\n<h2>The Preparation</h2>\n<h4>7. Have slides</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some amazing live-coding talks.  I’ve given one myself at a meetup.  There is definitely a place for them, as well as for minimally visual talks with 2-3 slides.  But if you’re aiming for informative, structuring your talk around a good slide deck is your best bet.</p>\n<p>Slides shouldn’t have too much information: they’re the backbone of your talk, and aren’t meant to stand alone<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  Instead, they provide structure both for you and the audience as you move through your presentation.</p>\n<h4>8. Have a talk track</h4>\n<p>Slides are good, but they’re just the start.  You need a talk track that is more than just “reading off my slides”.  To feel really well prepared for a talk, I usually write out a complete script for the talk that I intend to follow, and then edit that after several practice run throughs.  For the actual talk I usually boil most of that script down to bullet points to keep me focused.  There will be some experimentation needed there to figure out what works best for you.</p>\n<h4>9. Make sure your A/V setup works!</h4>\n<p>I was reminded just last week about the importance of testing that you can give your talk in the venue you’re speaking at with the equipment you have as early as possible.  I was forced to give a talk last week on my manager’s laptop after mine failed to connect to the venue’s projector.  It ended up being a dumb problem on my side that I could have solved if I’d verified my setup earlier and had more time to figure things out.  So that’s my a/v setup parable.  The things to remember here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show up early and test your setup if at all possible (event organizers are usually happy to help with this and may insist on this)</li>\n<li>Bring your own adapters.  In the US, at least be ready to connect to HDMI and VGA.  I can’t speak to what might be common internationally, but at the very least it’s good to be paranoid</li>\n<li>Make sure to bring a power cable.  Your slides going black in the middle of your talk is not a good look.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Delivery</h2>\n<h4>10. Have notes</h4>\n<p>So now it is time to actually give your talk.  Make sure to bring notes.  Most presentation software programs like Powerpoint and Keynote have nice built in presenter note features for this (make sure to practice setting it up so that you see the notes and the audience just sees the slide). You also can just use paper notes in a notebook. Notes are important to keep you on track in case you freeze, and may be something you just want to read for portions of the talk.</p>\n<p>Here again you have several choices for how to handle notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can read your talk from a script. This lowers your ability to connect with your audience, but it is low risk, and you’ll guarantee that you’ll hit the content you intend to.  As a native english speaker, I probably underrate this a bit too.  If you’re presenting in a second language and reading can help you confidently deliver the material, it may be worth doing so.</li>\n<li>You can work off of bullet point notes, which were ideally pulled out of a full script that you wrote originally.  So you’re talking naturally, with some notes to give you structure and help pull you back in if you’re fumbling around.</li>\n<li>You can memorize your talk verbatim.  This is hard and high risk (if you forget something it can become an awkward stumble as you try to get back to your script), but has a chance at being a very compelling experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have found that bullet point notes work well for me, but if you’re great at memorizing things, or would be more comfortable reading and are ok with sacrificing some connection to the audience, all 3 can work.</p>\n<h4>11. Give context and set expectations (again)</h4>\n<p>At the start of your talk, you want to answer 3 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are you?</li>\n<li>Who is this for?</li>\n<li>What are you going to be talking about?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may think you answered these questions with your description, but there will definitely be people at your talk who didn’t read your description, and others who misread it.  Giving context at the beginning of your talk helps people prepare to hear the things that matter in your talk.  If this is a conference, it lets people decide whether they want to stay for your talk or not.  Don’t be discouraged if some people walk out of your talk after your explanation.  That’s a sign that you’ve done a good job clarifying the scope of your talk, and honoring their time. Having those folks leave now will be a much better experience than having them staring at Facebook and distracting others through out your talk, and it is now more likely that the people in front of you are the audience you wanted to address.</p>\n<h4>12. Be Confident and Grateful</h4>\n<p>When you know your topic and you’ve prepared well, the actual speaking part will usually end up being the easiest part.  So be confident.  Not because you’re already a great speaker, or because of some feeling of baseless optimism, but because you’ve done the work to be ready and you have the structure around you to succeed.  Also make sure to be grateful.  A bunch of people showed up to hear you speak.  Appreciate them, give them your best and hopefully try to answer their questions.  Speaking is a great opportunity, and I hope you get the chance to try it.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rands has a <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/archives/out-loud/\">great post</a> on preparing for a presentation.

In other words, when I open a browser and enter a url then hit enter, and a website shows up on my screen what can you tell me about what is happening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usually I get one of a few responses:</p>\n<h4>1. The clueless shrug</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uh….  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have no idea what to do with the question.  Things get awkward. This is mostly for junior positions but still isn’t the best sign.  Sometimes a few prods will get things back on track.</p>\n<h4>2. The bare minimum</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is asking a server for the site and the server sends you the site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people can give a very basic response, but don’t give a lot of details.  This again mostly corresponds to less experienced devs and can be fine as a starting spot with some follow-up questions.</p>\n<h4>3. The CliffNotes</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your browser sends an HTTP request which gets routed through a local modem/router and gets sent to a name server for its url extension.  That name server routes the request to the correct IP address, which will resolve to some sort of web server.  That server will serve up either some static files, or run some backend code in order to generate a resource (probably an html page).  When the HTML page is returned, your browser will parse it, which will likely generate more requests, and the cycle will repeat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people know how some of this works, maybe with a few hazy areas and can explain it in a reasonably straightforward way.  An explanation like this is a great start.</p>\n<h4>4. The Geek-out</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><Some variation on the previous answer... followed by:> Let me tell you all about my in depth knowledge of &#x3C;HTTP_network routing_JavaScript parsing/TCP/other related topic></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people dive in and explode with information.</p>\n<h3>So why is this a good interview question again?</h3>\n<p>So which answer is best?  The geek-out right?  Well… its great when somebody gets there, but in my mind this question is more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to make the case that this is a pretty bad interview question.  It’s not clear what the expected answer is.  When I ask it in junior dev interviews, they often don’t have much of a clue how to answer it.  And it’s not strictly answerable in full detail by pretty much anyone.  But I’d argue that those things actually end up being strengths.  I like this question for 5 reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the candidate’s ability to deal with ambiguity.</strong>  The question is intentionally vague and open ended.  Am I just looking for a perfunctory response like “it gets a resource from a server”?  Do I want a deep dive into how DNS works?  It’s ambiguous.  Candidates can respond to that ambiguity in one of a few ways.</p>\n<p>They can freeze because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>They can ask a clarifying question.</p>\n<p>They can make a guess at what I want and start going down that road, while reading my reaction to see if they’re still on track.</p>\n<p>Or they can decide they know what I want (or what they want to tell me) and shoot off like a rocket (potentially for a very long time).</p>\n<p>This is super useful information in an interview because developers deal with ambiguity all the time.  When a candidate encounters unclear requirements from a product manager, or unclear documentation from another developer, it’s good to have an idea how they’ll respond<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the breadth of a candidates knowledge.</strong> - For the most part, when I interview people, I ask them questions about the role they’re applying for:  Front-End Dev, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, etc.  But this question gives a candidate the chance to show that they understand what’s happening up and down the web stack from the code they interact with the most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate a chance to explain a complex technical topic.</strong> - In my mind, good communication ability is the most important skill for a developer once they’ve achieved a minimum level of technical competence.  Being able to talk about problems and solutions clearly and explain them to a variety of audiences matters, and it matters a lot.  Can the candidate summarize a complex technical topic without getting bogged down in details?  Are they communicating with me (verbally or otherwise) to make sure I’m following their explanation?  Or are they fading off into a rambling run-on explanation of a trivial detail without any big picture context?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It forces the candidate to confront something they don’t know.</strong> - The internet is a perfect example of the Isaac Newton quote about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants\">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>.  It is the culmination of 50+ years of research and work on networked computer systems.  No candidate I interview for a web development position is going to understand every detail of how it works, because you can always go a layer deeper in the stack or afield into crazier edge case behavior.  So at some point in questioning (possibly very early), this question exhausts every candidate’s knowledge.  The question is how do they react?  Some candidates start guessing at things.  Some admit they don’t know.  Some try to skirt around areas they don’t feel confident in and work at avoiding any questions where they would have to admit they don’t know something.  And some will actually ask me how part of the system works.  This again is helpful because “not knowing the answer” is such a common experience in real world web dev.  It’s great to have some clues to how a candidate handles that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate an opportunity to show off what they know.</strong>  I’ve gotten some amazing answers to this question.  It turns out some candidates actually know a lot about networking and HTTP/TCP/nameservers.  Some can give detailed answers about browsers and how they parse resources and display the DOM.  Maybe they just know a lot of random trivia about URLs and DNS.  Regardless, this is a chance to show off and prove that they’ve delved deep into something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think every interview question should be like this one.  Most should probably directly relate to the work the candidate is doing, be clearly comparable in an objective way candidate to candidate, and not risk sending the interview down a 10 minute rabbit hole.  But this one is my favorite, and I think there’s a place for questions that show how a candidate might handle some real world lack of structure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_benmccormick\">@_benmccormick</a> to tell me your favorite interview question.

Here’s a small sample of buzzwords, trends and methodology that are concerned with reducing the time between making a change to software and seeing the results:</p>\n<p><strong>Agile -</strong> Agile is all about delivering working software sooner, so that you produce value faster and learn lessons quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD) -</strong> Test driven development is a process designed to let you know as soon as possible when a change has had the desired effect during development, and also sets up the conditions under which you know as soon as possible when a change has had an undesirable side effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Devops -</strong> Devops has been a push over the past decade to automate and control all parts of the software creation, deployment and maintenance life cycle.  Automation like continuous integration servers that run your test after every commit, chat bots that alert you based on site performance metrics, and servers that automatically build a copy of every branch for testing in a virtual machine are all examples of Devops being used to speed up the point when you know that a change worked or didn’t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Experience -</strong> This is a more recent buzzword that I’ve seen thrown around a lot in the JavaScript community, talking about improving developer tools.  Developer tool features like hot reloading, nicer error messages, specialized debugging and profiling tools, and fast build times all fight this same problem of getting a result as fast as possible.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Loops</h3>\n<p>All of these tools are concerned with <em>feedback loops</em>, the process by which developers, designers and product managers make changes, learn about the effect of those changes, and then iterate.  Teams with slow feedback loops spend a lot of time planning and thinking about every change, making sure to get everything right. They feel the cost distinctly each time they make a mistake, and it generally leads to a more cautious mindset.  Teams with fast feedback loops can plan too.  But they also have the option of taking a more experimental attitude and learning from their attempts. This can happen at multiple scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>developer</strong> can try out 5 different CSS rules in the UI in a few seconds if his UI is hot reloading and he doesn’t have to wait for a whole SCSS bundle to recompile</li>\n<li>A <strong>QA team</strong> can immediately know if somebody pushes a change that would breaks tests if they have a CI server set up to run tests against every new commit to each branch.</li>\n<li>A <strong>product team</strong> can see quickly that a new feature is problematic if he’s able to see detailed analytics on usage, instead of waiting to do enough user interviews to get a full picture</li>\n<li>A <strong>company</strong> can change direction if they ship an MVP early instead of attempting to wait and release the perfect product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Your Loops</h3>\n<p>As a developer who wants to make your product better, one of your best power moves is finding ways to speed up feedback loops.  Here are 4 suggestions for how to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions Early:</strong> One of the most important feedback loops for a developer is between yourself and the individual in charge of defining what you’re building.  If you simply take requirements from your PM/Manager/Lead/Designer/CEO/Client and go off and build your giant amazing piece of beautiful software, without any clarification, there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get to build it again, this time twice as fast without the budget.  Asking clarifying questions early prevents you wasting your time and exposes understanding gaps and technical barriers while there’s still a chance to deal with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Feedback as you go:</strong> Similarly, anytime you have a chance to get feedback on work while it is still in process from somebody who might object in the end, do it.  This means instead of building everything at once, work on smaller chunks.  This often takes time and thought, but the earlier you create <em>complete</em> chunks of code that can be evaluated and ideally shipped on their own, the more likely you are to ship something great in the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your environment:</strong> Have you spent time figuring out how to work as efficiently as possible?  Have you done it recently?  If not it might be worth re-evaluating your setup on a quarterly basis or so, figuring out what tools you can use to get quicker feedback, and also learning the shortcuts, tricks and new features for the tools that you do use.</li>\n<li><strong>Ship Code:</strong> Ultimately the best feedback comes when people are using what you’ve written.  Whether that’s compliments, bug reports, feature requests, anger or viral adoption, shipping will tell you things that you would never have been certain of while iterating on your own.  If you’re struggling to get code out, always fix that first.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"strategies-tactics-moves,soft-skills,obvious-things","topics":["career","leadership","productivity"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"how-se-add-value","title":"How Software Engineers Produce Value","description":"A high level view at how we can turn programming skills into business value","layout":"post","path":"/how-se-add-value","date":"2019/12/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I had the opportunity this week to walk a software engineer who is new to the field through some lessons I’ve learned over the years about how software engineers add value to the business.  It seemed generally applicable, so here’s a cleaned up version of what I shared.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What Is Value?</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to think of software engineering work as a series of task where you’re given instructions and you make the computer do what the designer / PM / CEO asked.  Or as a series of fun problem solving challenges that you’re somehow getting paid to complete.  Both of those views will eventually lead you to make suboptimal decisions when it comes to helping your business and growing in your role though.  Instead consider the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Software Developers create value through shipping working code that solves important user problems in a predictable manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This captures a number of important things.</p>\n<h3>Shipping</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real Artists Ship - <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineer’s super power compared to other roles is that we get to build.  We create new things, add new behaviors, and ultimately (for a product company) control the shape of the product our company is built around.  This only has value when software actually ships though.  When we’re not shipping, it’s actually worse than just being slow to deliver value, because of a few non-obvious factors.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>unshipped code rots.</strong>  When we leave code in a branch 90% done, it doesn’t just stay the same.  It’s quite common for our situation to get worse.  Our teammates check in code that may cause merge conflicts, or worse just doesn’t take into account the unshipped code and sets us up for subtle bugs.  And when we do get back to the work we’ve often lost valuable mental context that makes any remaining work or testing harder and more error-prone.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we learn from shipping!</strong>  It’s quite common in software development for a developer or team to complete 90% of their feature according to the spec, only to find that they have another 90% of the work to go.  Doing the work to push things through to production inherently de-risks things, because we learn what the challenges are, and we know how long the work took.  Up until then, we will always have unknowns.  And when software goes out to users, we get to hear their feedback as well.  Shipped software lets us learn from our users (and from the performance of our system) and make adjustments that we wouldn’t have known about if we sat on the code.</p>\n<p>So how do we get to shipping?  First, it’s important to push things through to completion rather than allowing ourselves to jump from project to project, making progress without finishing, and incurring a lot of cost from context switching.  Soemtimes this may mean imposing kanban style <a href=\"https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/\">work in progress limits</a> on ourselves.  Second, its often helpful to break things into smaller chunks.  Small code reviews are easier to complete, test, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/22/better-code-feedback\">review</a> and verify.  So multiple small changes will often go through faster than the same changes bundled together into a big chunk.  This can go too far, but as long as your changes work in isolation and provide value, I’d encourage erring on this side when in doubt.</p>\n<h3>Working Code</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[We Prefer] working software over comprehensive documentation - <em>The Agile Manifesto</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Software engineers are responsible for their code working.  At the simplest level that means delivering code that doesn’t crash when run in the intended way.  As we grow and mature as developers however, we should aspire to  learn to write code that will scale to any reasonable load the system might see (and maybe even to unreasonable loads), code that handles odd input or context gracefully, and code that is easy to modify and maintain.  We should also take responsibility for proving that it works; writing tests, making the code easy to monitor in production, and providing good logging for debugging all fall under a software engineer’s domain. We also should make sure that our definition of working matches what the business needs, not just a pedantic reading of whatever spec we’re working off of.  More on that in a moment.</p>\n<h3>Solving Important User Problems</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just really funny- What the Customer Wanted expanded <a href=\"https://t.co/kdr7HKTSDy\">pic.twitter.com/kdr7HKTSDy</a></p>&mdash; Frank Spillers (@farreaching) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/farreaching/status/764256002053025792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>Software Engineers can be quite inventive in the ways they write code without solving important user problems.  Some common routes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working on their own pet projects over the prioritized business problems</strong> - Tech improvement work and engineer-driven projects are part of a healthy organization, but if they consistently replace work that was scoped based on user requests / feedback, they can cause problems</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec without solving the original problem</strong> - This is partially a design/product problem, but its often possible to meet all the stated requirements for a project without solving the original user pain point.  Great engineers understand exactly what problem they’re trying to solve with a feature and will always step back to evaluate whether they’re succeeding throughout the development process.</li>\n<li><strong>Matching the spec and causing new problems</strong> - Oftentimes our efforts to fix cause or expose new problems.  When we dodge responsibility by ignoring or hiding those problems instead of openly evaluating tradeoffs or working to improve the solution, we’re not providing all the value we’re capable of.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are ultimately issues of ownership. When we’re invested in our work, we will want to work on useful problems and make sure they produce real value.  If you’re consistently not feeling that way, it may be time to find something else to work on.</p>\n<h3>In a predictable manner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources - <em>Fred Brooks</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, now we come to the section that is the <em>boring part</em> for many software engineers.  But as somebody who has recently converted to the management side of the fence, the ability to ship predictably is incredibly important.</p>\n<p>It’s important for software engineers to ship predictably in 2 senses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of when something is likely to ship among the people who need to know</li>\n<li>There is ongoing understanding of how something will work when it will ship among the people who need to know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Estimating software engineering projects is not an exact science. Nobody reasonable expects estimation perfection from software engineers, especially those new to the field.  Instead we aim to be as accurate as possible, and especially to be transparent as those estimates change over time.</p>\n<p>When we encounter obstacles, it’s important to be realistic about what they mean to schedules and update the important people in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>For those working on a product team that may be a manager and a PM, for those building something solo, that may be the customers or internal users of the software directly.  It’s never fun to say something is going to be late, but its always better to say that we’ll miss a date that is 2 weeks away than to tell somebody for the first time that you’ve missed the date that was 2 days ago.</p>\n<p>Communicating about the scope of work is just as important as schedule.  If we find out a piece of a feature is unfeasable or we dropped it due to time pressure, its important to communicate that.  Depending on your team/product, that may mean sharing with people directly, updating documentation, or just making the new behavior clear in an interface.</p>\n<h3>It’s a process</h3>\n<p>Nobody starts out their first software engineering job with a fully evolved sense of how to estimate, scope and document their work.  Most have no clue how to think about building a system to be scalable or when to escalate problems to other members of the team.  These are skills learned through hard experience.  Make sure to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/05/18/obvious-things\">always be reflecting</a> on what you’re experiencing though.  Experience combined with reflection is a powerful mixture, and eventually will lead to growth.

Without much work, it’s easy to find <em>Senior Engineers</em> with 2 years of professional experience, <em>junior developer</em> job descriptions requesting 5 years of experience, <em>tech lead</em> roles focused purely on technology, <em>tech lead</em> roles where the lead is managing a team, and who can tell the difference between a <em>CTO</em> and a <em>VP of Engineering</em> anyway?  This results in weird title shifts when developers switch jobs, odd or unfair salary distributions, and a world where it is very difficult to understand what a career path looks like in this industry.</p>\n<p>Camille Fournier’s book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p\">The Manager’s Path</a> steps into this breach by laying out a clear look at an engineering management-focused career path. The book runs through a series of roles: <em>Mentor</em> to <em>Tech Lead</em> to <em>Manager</em> to <em>Manager of Managers</em> all the way up to <em>Executive</em>. For each role she describes what the job is,  walks through what type of challenges you might face in the role after a promotion, and offers practical advice on overcoming those challenges.</p>\n<p>I found it to be an extremely engaging read, and the best description of what it actually looks like to advance in technical leadership roles I’ve ever read.  Because she focuses on skills and responsibilities more than titles, it’s possible to apply her advice across large and small companies, even those with wonky title structures.  It helped me think about what skills I need to be building in my career, and gave me a glimpse of what next steps look like.</p>\n<p>The focus on common challenges and how to face them was also helpful, though whole books could (and have) been written on those challenges and how to face them at each level.  The Manager’s Path serves as a good starting point here, identifying the challenges and giving good solid general advice for facing them.  For those new to a role it could help them identify where they’re weak or uncomfortable, and serve as a starting point to a deeper dive into those areas.</p>\n<p>As I read the book, I immediately thought of 4 or 5 people at various points in their career I knew who could benefit greatly from reading this book.  If you’re working in the software world and think that you long term are interested in advancing in your career beyond your current role, there will probably be interesting tidbits in here for you.  Even those who are sure they <strong>don’t</strong> want to be in management could benefit from understanding the perspectives of what engineering managers actually <em>do</em>.  The book is also structured so that the first few chapters are highly relevant for both technical and manager track developers; tech lead is an important role on both tracks.

Some of this is macro level; Where do we split chunks of related functionality into different files?  Some of it is micro level; what should the rules be for when we use an inline function instead of pulling it out into its own named method?  Some of it is trivial; Do we use <code class=\"language-text\">_</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> to separate words in file names?  In our current codebase we’re not always consistent on many of these issues.  As we’ve discussed the various issues, I realized that some of them bothered me more than others, and (more interestingly to me) my ideas have changed here over time.</p>\n<h3>The Platonic Ideal</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a perfectly consistent system, 3 developers writing the same module would produce line by line identical code</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s an extreme point of view out there that says “while a perfectly consistent system might not be possible, the closer we can get to that the better”.  The benefits of consistency are many: consistent naming helps with code search and connecting different parts of a system.  Consistent code structure makes code easier to scan once a developer is familiar with the system, and it makes exceptions stand out as something intentional and interesting.  Consistent formatting removes potential distractions.   So what’s not to love?  Shouldn’t we always try to add more consistency?  I see 2 primary reasons why it might not be worth trying to enforce every single rule we can come up with.</p>\n<h4>We’re only human</h4>\n<p>The first reason not to enforce “everything” is that our human attention spans can only internalize so many rules at once.  When we’re trying to remember a large number of rules, its easy to miss one.  But more importantly, when we’re writing code or reviewing it, focusing too much on human enforced consistency rules can distract from the actual purpose of the code, making it harder to notice the substance of code because we’re so focused on the form.</p>\n<h4>Standards too soon</h4>\n<p>The other thing that can happen when you try to standardize everything is a loss of creativity.  Sometimes it’s helpful to experiment for a while to find the right pattern in a codebase.  In an ideal situation experiments like that will happen on the side, or be explored in branches, but for small teams or new codebases, it will likely happen at least partially in production.</p>\n<h3>User Friendly Consistency</h3>\n<p>So what <strong>can</strong> we do to get the benefits of consistency? The 4 ways I like to see this happen are:</p>\n<h4>Automation</h4>\n<p>The best way to enforce stylistic consistency and other straightforward things like naming conventions is to use automation.  Linters like <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> and auto-formatters like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>.  My rule here is that any linter rule that is about stylistic consistency should be auto-fixable, if not it isn’t clear enough or isn’t worth it.  For “correctness rules” it can be ok to flag errors without auto-fixing, if human judgement is needed.</p>\n<h4>Code Review Checklists</h4>\n<p>Code reviews can be a good way to limitedly enforce consistency; but its good to limit scope to avoid <a href=\"https://samsaccone.com/posts/code-reviews-not-nits.html\">developers trying to become human compilers</a>.  If you try to enforce too many things in code reviews, its easy for people to get caught up in going through a list and forget to apply human judgement to the context of the current code. But <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews\">code review checklists</a> are a good way to make a coordinated push on high value items that are either new or often neglected.  This checklist should consist of a few important things to check during every review. The list should be re-examined on a regular basis and ideally kept to 5 or less items.</p>\n<h4>Focused Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Sometimes its appropriate to have “refactoring initiatives” to standardize on a particular pattern over time.  This can be good for standardizing on a particular library for a task, or removing an older pattern that persists in the codebase after a better way has been found.  My advice here is to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/\">only do one of these at a time, and complete them before starting a new one</a>.  One of the biggest causes of inconsistency is when a team attempts to ”<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">standardize</a>” on a solution, then abandons that for a new solution without finish the migration, resulting in a <a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html\">lava layer architecture</a>.</p>\n<h4>Focus on the high level</h4>\n<p>If there is one place to apply human consistency checks its at the structural level.  If your high level patterns are consistent, the code base will be easy to navigate, and modular code written in a standardized high level structure will be <a href=\"https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to\">easy to delete</a>.  Overall low level code that is inconsistent or poorly written is easier to overcome than high level code as long as you’re taking advantage of code reviews and the other methods suggested here to improve new code, because most low level code is only read occasionally.  So high traffic “messy code” can be a focus of refactoring efforts, and the rest can continue working without disturbing anything.</p>\n<p>Messy code is much more problematic at a structural level though, because when different areas of the code are arranged in different ways, it becomes much harder to find functionality when debugging.  This type of inconsistency also tends to make bulk improvements harder, as you have to have a much greater understanding of all the ways a codebase is put together.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/01/consistency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"soft-skills,radical-candor-book,obvious-things","topics":["leadership","management"],"category":"eng-management","key":"herding-lions","title":"Herding Lions","description":"Creating change starts with respect","layout":"post","path":"/2019/05/27/herding-lions","date":"2019/05/27","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I used to find myself using the term “herding cats” a lot when confronting inertia, disorganization or ambiguity in work situations.  <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=herding%20cats\">Urban Dictionary</a> actually endorses this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The phrase herding cats comes from the common saying that something involving coordination of many different groups or people is as difficult as herding cats.

It’s been an interesting experience, and because this is a fairly common way to transition into engineering management<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, I thought it might be worthwhile to share some lessons I’ve learned so far.</p>\n<h4>1. Time discipline is key</h4>\n<p>The biggest challenge of this transition was learning to be a manager.  It’s a whole new job!  But the biggest challenge specific to the management/developer split has been managing my time.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit loose with my time management.  I do a lot based on my mental state at a particular time; if I’m tired or uninspired I may lean more into grunt work like documentation, code reviews, or more “scripted” code work.  If I’m in the zone I’ll dive into big tasks, and if someone comes to me with a problem I tend to context shift into it and go from there.</p>\n<p>This “time management strategy” hasn’t held up at all while trying to balance manager and development strategies.  Basically because of the blend of <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">maker and manager schedules</a>.  Developers need long uninterrupted periods of time to be productive, while managers tend to operate on a much more social and interrupt driven schedule.  They’re naturally opposed.</p>\n<p>Working with this tension requires discipline and planning.  For me personally I’ve started planning my schedule for the next day at the end of the previous day, batching my checking of Slack/email and being more thoughtful when somebody asks for my time.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning my schedule for the next day</strong> is a tip I picked up from <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work</a>.  To close out the day, I review the things I’ll need to handle the next day, and block out my calendar with time for different tasks for the next day.  This does mean that my calendar <em>always looks completely booked for the current day</em>.  So far this has served as a feature not a bug; I can still move things if something urgent comes up and it has a way of encouraging people to schedule less urgent things in advance.  Note that scheduling like this doesn’t mean you can’t change plans; I do all the time.  It just means that you start with a plan and can be thoughtful about how you vary off of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Batching Slack and email</strong> has been something I’ve known would be good for me forever.  It feels good in the moment to be the guy who is constantly available, but the cost of distraction is higher than you think.  So far, management has been a catalyst for me buckling down here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I get a lot more unexpected requests for my time now than I did previously.  I’ve found that batching my email and Slack reading combined with <strong>a willingness to suggest a meeting later in the day or the next morning rather than <em>right now</em></strong> has helped me protect blocks of productivity and focus, without making me an unresponsive manager.  Most things can sit for 2 hours without blowing up anyone’s day.  The key is to ask enough to identify the 5% of things that can’t wait.</p>\n<p>Those 3 tactics have worked for me, but overall it comes down to being intentional about your time.  If you let yourself be blown by the wind while splitting dual responsibilities, one of them will almost always receive the short end of the stick.</p>\n<h4>2. Team success metrics are the only ones that matter</h4>\n<p>When you’re acting as both a developer and a manager, it can be tempting to hold yourselves to 2 sets of metrics: management metrics and development metrics.  This is a mistake.  It will cause you to over-prioritize your own tasks and hurt your team’s long term growth.</p>\n<p>Focusing on personal development metrics and goals can lead to over-prioritizing them for a few reasons. First, development goals tend to be much “cleaner” than management goals; it’s easier to tell what you’ve achieved.  Second, if you’re transitioning into this role from a dev role, you probably are much more comfortable with these tasks, and so they can act as a safe place where you avoid having to stretch yourself.  And finally, if you moved into this role from a senior dev position, it can be easy to tell yourself that this is actually the best way to get stuff done.  And you may be right… in the short term.</p>\n<p>So what’s the antidote?  Focus on team productivity and view your own work as just an extra card you have to play in your hand.  It’s an advantage you have over less technical managers, but if you don’t set to working developing other strengths, you’re not going to be able to grow, and if you’re monopolizing the important work your team won’t be able to step up into new roles.  So play that card, but do it with caution, and always as a means rather than an end.</p>\n<h4>3. This isn’t long term sustainable; have a plan</h4>\n<p>Hybrid Management / Developer roles aren’t a long term game.  Aside from the scheduling tension I mentioned above, once you move into this role you’re either going to be slowly giving up responsibilities and watching your tech skills slowly move off the cutting edge as you focus on learning how to manager your team and developing others to fill the roles you once did, or you’re going to be failing as a manager as you try to cling too tightly to your senior individual contributor responsibilities.  So if you want to avoid that, it’s important to be evaluating how you want your career to evolve.  A role like this can be a first step up a chain, or part of a <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">dev to manager pendulum</a>.  You also might discover that management isn’t for you and decide to move back.  I’m committed to this for a set period of time, and that’s helped me to work through the days when I wonder what I actually accomplished, and think strategically about what I need to get better at.</p>\n<h4>4. Best Management resources</h4>\n<p>So this isn’t a learning so much, but as a newbie manager, probably the best thing I can do is point you to the resources I’ve found helpful.

This isn’t a moral statement.  I’ve done and enjoyed both.  Working with a distributed team requires a different set of skills, especially when you’re a leader.  Today I want to share the most helpful lessons I’ve learned over the last year managing a distributed team.</p>\n<h4>Evaluate process and outcomes, not inputs</h4>\n<p>Focusing on output` is great advice for any team, but it’s easier and more important when managing remote teams.  When you’re not in the office with people, you won’t see when they start in the morning or finish at night.  You won’t be able to tell if they’re taking long coffee breaks or checking Amazon between tasks.  You’ll have to evaluate them on their output and on the methods they use to get work done.</p>\n<p>Evaluating on outputs is tricky for tech work in the short term.  It’s often hard to tell how hard a specific task should have been.  But over the long run, you’ll need to find ways to see if developers are meeting their goals, and focus on that over the exact times they did work.  And this is good, because that is actually what matters.</p>\n<p>Output is a lagging indicator though.  In the short term, what you can evaluate if “butts in seats” isn’t an option.  I recommend process: is work being documented, are tests being written and are code reviews being done in a timely manner?  The nice thing about this is that you can check these things in low touch ways; by reviewing your issue tracking and version control systems rather than having status meetings or sending distracting slack messages.  This idea comes up in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XBg1iv\">Camille Fournier’s book The Manager’s Path</a>, where she argues persuasively for always doing your information gathering in ways that don’t disrupt your team first.</p>\n<h4>1-1s are extra important</h4>\n<p>Let’s say Sarah has some lingering concerns about her current project that she’s not yet ready to raise to the full group.  When I work in the same office with Sarah, she can drop by my desk anytime to talk through a small issue.  When we’re working remotely, that may not feel as comfortable for a variety of reasons.  Good 1-1s provide space for the little things to come out.</p>\n<h4>When you get in-person time, focus on the relationship</h4>\n<p>Currently I get together with my team (and my manager) about once a quarter.  Initially my instinct was to save the “big work stuff” for that time.  And I still try to get a few big conversations in each time, mostly around career development.  But the most value from these visits has come in the gaps, when I go out to lunch with my team and chat, or we get together with a larger group after work.  Time spent together builds trust, and that trust lingers and pays off when you’re back on the other side of the internet the next week.</p>\n<h4>Async communication is great.  Don’t neglect “face to face” time.</h4>\n<p>“Embrace async communication” is common remote work advice.  When you get stuff done through email/slack/Github/Invision/etc you have fewer meetings and more flow time for your team.  Which is great!  My team takes advantage of “async” tools every day.  But I also try to be intentional about working in “face to face” time through Zoom.  For my team that’s a daily standup and weekly 1-1s, but it could be different for another team’s process.  The key is to not <em>only</em> rely on writing.  Writing is an amazing way to communicate, but it will always lack the context of the human face.  For now I’m aiming for a mix of mostly async with regular “internet face to face”, and occasional “in person”.</p>\n<p>Make sure to personalize your communication as well.  If Jerry tends to miss all nuance when you communicate in text, try to spend more time talking over zoom to make sure you’re communicating.  On the other hand if Jennifer has a tendency to lose track of what you’re asking her to do, you may want to give instructions through a text medium, where you can use it for accountability later.</p>\n<h4>Hire for remote success</h4>\n<p>Not everyone is going to thrive in a remote role.  Most companies hiring remote recognize this and try to filter for it in some form. A lot of companies’ response here is to “only hire senior”.  Which is probably a workable heuristic in some ways.  Developers that have a proven track record of success probably have built up some habits that will help them succeed in remote work even if they aren’t naturally inclined to it.  But hiring only senior folks is expensive, and makes things like diversity and career growth paths harder.</p>\n<p>I haven’t done this enough to draw any hard conclusions on remote hiring yet.  But the qualities I want to evaluate for are independence, technological comfort, writing skills, and a history of taking the initiative to seize opportunities (in whatever domain).  Obviously that’s in addition to normal hiring criteria.</p>\n<h4>Tools and Process matter</h4>\n<p>The worst way to work remote is to not commit to it.  Commitment means aligning your process toward remote work.  Some lessons here.</p>\n<p><strong>First, Hybrid meetings are harmful to your team</strong>.  There are 3 ways to do meetings: in person, remote, or hybrid.  An in person meeting involves putting a number of humans in a small room for an hour and letting them talk through an issue.  A remote meeting connects various people from the comforts of whatever work venue they’ve chosen, and discussion ensues over the internet.  In a hybrid meeting, some people are in the room, and some are connecting remotely.  Hybrid meetings are hell for the remote folks.  Usually they can’t hear at least one person well.  They can’t match faces to voices, lose context of what is happening in the room, and are sometimes just plain ignored by the folks in the room.</p>\n<p>I really didn’t understand how bad this was until I did it myself a few times.  If you’re a leader who uses or tolerates hybrid meetings, I highly recommend trying to call into them remotely a few times.  As the boss you’ll get a slightly different experience, but ask yourself: are you a first class meeting participant when you’re calling in remote?  If not, is it acceptable to you to treat your remote workers as second class participants?</p>\n<p><strong>Second, Use good tools</strong>.  Bad collaboration software is a drag if you’re working with people in person.  It’s a killer for remote teams.  Use software that lets you communicate in timely and useful ways, keep your project critical information organized, and lets your team focus on getting stuff done.  There are hundreds of good tools out there these days, so there’s no excuse for using bad ones.  My recommendations, which are not particularly controversial and also not the only good options: use Zoom for video chat, Slack for messaging, Bitbucket, GitHub, or Gitlab for Version Control, Trello or Jira<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> for task tracking depending on the size of your team, and Google Drive for keeping documents and documentation together<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">I… don’t love Jira.  But Trello doesn’t scale forever, and I haven’t seen anything significantly better than Jira for large teams.<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">My team doesn’t actually use Google Docs for documentation, we use Confluence.  Which is… worse than Jira.  So this is more of a “don’t be miserable like me” recommendation than one based on experience.  I’d be curious to hear if anyone has a documentation/wiki tool that they love.<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/06/24/managing-a-distributed-team"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"soft-skills,fe-concerns,react-confessions","topics":["leadership","career"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"obvious-things","title":"Obvious Things","description":"Obvious things that I still end up learning over and over again","layout":"post","path":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things","date":"2019/05/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I saw a tweet thread a few weeks ago that made me think:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There’s a bit of a meme in some parts that there is value in saying, out loud, “I realize that I am surprised.” For similar reasons, I often subvocalize “I believe I now understand the type of situation the ‘trivial’ advice was preparing me for.” <a href=\"https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH\">https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH</a></p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115751939210223616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And then you repeat it to someone and they say “lol that is obvious” and you wonder if you know the advice well enough yet to correct them on how not obvious it is going to be for their next 10 years.</p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115752453910061056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>I realized that I’ve encountered plenty of pieces of wisdom in my software career that have this property; I see them as clear and obvious when put in the abstract, but only learn to actually apply them by repeatedly failing to do so.  This is what people talk about when they say something is “hard earned experience” I guess.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples from my career:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>In the long run, rate of improvement (or regression) matters more than current level</strong> - This has applications in hiring, code quality, and finding/staying in a job.  But it’s often easier to observe how good something is now than to see how its changing, and I often fail to properly estimate what a trend means for a situation 1-3 years down the road.  It’s also easy to mis-apply this principle when you for get about the “long run” part.  A new employee with tons of potential won’t help you when you need an experienced hand <em>now</em> and fixing technical debt can easily cost you your ability to hit a quarterly objective.  Knowing how to balance these long and short term goals is something I still struggle with all the time.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewriting from scratch is (almost) never worth it</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/\">Joel Spoelsky</a> wrote about this way back in 2000 and I remember reading that article nearly a decade ago and nodding along.  I seem to have infinite capacity to convince myself that my current situation fits in those parentheses though.  In my career this has mostly been a problem where I’m able to more accurately forecast the pain that would ensue from fixing what exists (because that code exists and is easier to work with), while I appear to systematically underestimate the pain of building the new thing (because the internet told me it would be great, and the code doesn’t exist for me to nitpick yet).</li>\n<li><strong>Always consider multiple options</strong> - Pretty much any decision (technical or otherwise) benefits from having multiple contenders.  This seems obvious.  But I have often let myself fall into situations where I’m choosing between just 2 options, or really just choosing whether or not to do 1 thing.  This has applications in technology choices, job choices, responding to another person’s provocations, and more.  I intuitively know that more options are good, and I constantly miss opportunities to add options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how do we improve on these situations where we fail to apply <em>obvious</em> wisdom?  I’ve been learning a few things lately.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Always review what you’ve done on a regular basis</strong> - Do weekly reviews about how your week went.  Do quarterly reviews with yourself about how your job is going.  When you make big decisions, make sure to find a time to check back in later and evaluate how it went.  We make better decisions when we take the time to measure our results</li>\n<li><strong>Note Missed Opportunities</strong> - When you do those reviews, make sure to pay attention to when you missed an opportunity to apply something you <em>knew</em>.  Sometimes we make mistakes because we just didn’t know something.  It’s more common though that we didn’t properly apply our own principles and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify Cues</strong> - Identify the thing that you know you’re going to have to handle different next time.  Maybe you say “if I’m looking for a job, I should consider at least 4 or 5 different companies and not focus in on just one”, or if I’m asked to fix a legacy codebase, I will spend at least 3 months trying to improve it before considering a re-write,and I’ll look for real world comparisons to base a rewrite estimate on”.  Whatever it is for you, when you can identify situations where a specific action should take place, it can help you be better the next time instead of repeating the same old mistakes.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/05/18/obvious-things"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"radical-candor-book,clean-architecture-book,tech-leads-book","topics":["leadership","book review","management"],"category":"reviews","key":"resilient-management-book","title":"Book Review: Resilient Management","description":"A great collection of management wisdom","layout":"review","path":"/2019/07/22/book-review-resilient-management","date":"2019/07/22","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management\">Resilient Management</a> by Lara Hogan is a short and useful read for engineering managers who want to think more systematically about how they support their team.

It explicitly focused on the set of technical skills that you need to become a “senior” JavaScript developer.  While I’m happy with that post, I’ve always wanted to revisit the idea, because it is my strong belief that <em>once you’ve hit a minimum level of technical capability, only about 20% of career success is determined by your technical skills</em>.  The other 80% is composed of skills that can be loosely bundled under “soft skills”.</p>\n<p>You may quibble with my choice of percentage, but I don’t think the underlying idea that things other than technical ability is particularly controversial.  Even if they bitterly dismiss such things as “politics” most developers are aware that their careers are impacted by things that go beyond their ability to write algorithms.  What I haven’t seen much of however, are attempts to catalogue what these soft skills are, and how somebody might get better at them.  The second part is outside of the scope of a single post, though I will attempt to list resources here.  But the first is achievable, and that is what I will attempt to do here.</p>\n<p>The following is not an exhaustive list, but it covers 10 “soft skills” that I’ve seen have a clear impact on my career in software and those of others.  The best part? These are things you can grow in that will have an impact in your life outside of work, and in any career you might transition into in the future.</p>\n<h3>The Skills</h3>\n<h4>1. Clear Communication</h4>\n<p>While I’m making bold statements: A developer’s ability to communicate clearly is the single most important skill in determining the trajectory of their career.  Poor communicators are forced to rely on others to interpret their work, even when it is brilliant.  They will often create problems for others through miscommunications or lead teams to make suboptimal decisions because they were not able to explain the technical considerations involved in a situation.</p>\n<p>Great communicators on the other hand, enlighten.  They help teams understand what is really going on so that non-technical team members can make good decisions, and technical folk can work with confidence.  Great communicators cut through misunderstandings, expose ambiguity and poor assumptions, and can translate for team members who are having trouble making themselves heard.</p>\n<p>Communication skills are important for those on a management track, but they are just as important for those on a technical trajectory. Architects, Principal Engineers and Tech Leads must coordinate with many teams, teach less experienced developers, explain technical tradeoffs and document decisions and code.  Those are core parts of a senior technical employee’s job, and all of them come down to communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing\">The Importance Of Writing For Software Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codingame.com/blog/10-tips-to-improve-your-communication-skills-as-a-software-developer/\">10 Tips to Improve your Communication Skills as a Software Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Attention Management</h4>\n<p>This one is more commonly referred to as “time management”, but I agree with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">this recent NYT Op-Ed</a>: the mechanics of how we organize our time is less important than whether we end up spending it on the most important things.  This broadly encompasses the ability to prioritize, to prevent distractions from wreaking havoc on productivity, and the ability to find ways to get back on track when things go wrong or priorities change.</p>\n<p>This was a weakness for me early in my career: I got things done but often did them haphazardly or inefficiently.  One of my biggest sources of growth in the last few years has been finding ways to structure and prioritize my time better, while cutting out distractions.  This has been necessary due to life changes: I’m now a parent and have people reporting to me at work.  I wouldn’t be able to meet my current responsibilities with the habits I had as a 25 year old.  For me this has been largely about focusing in on a small amount of essential things and actively removing less important things from my life.  For others it may be more about establishing patterns and limits.  Either way, this requires planning and introspection first to be effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR\">Deep Work - Cal Newport</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scheduling-every-minute-of-my-day/\">Scheduling Every Minute of My Day - Brad Frost</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html\">Productivity Isn’t About Time Management, It’s about Attention Management - Adam Grant</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Initiative</h4>\n<p>If you see an opportunity or a problem, do you do something about it?  I’ve been reading a good amount of “manager books” recently, and in many of them a surprising amount of focus is dedicated to the question of how we create conditions when people are “empowered” to act.  And there certainly is an environmental factor here.  People are more likely to take initiative and risks when they’re not afraid of being punished for it.  But the individual also controls a lot here.  Developers who are willing to step up and take initiative in a situation can make an outsize impact.</p>\n<p>Do you have a piece of code or process on your team that everybody acknowledges is a bit wonky, but nobody has ever taken the time to fix even though it is slowly taking a toll on the team over time?  Are there simple things that you know could make your product better, but nobody has quite taken the time to get to them?  Those are the opportunities that initiative can turn into value.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/fix-like-no-ones-watching/\">Fix Like No One’s Watching</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Empathy</h4>\n<p>There is no meaningful software product that has been created in isolation.  One person may have written the code (though that is quite rare for software with any scale of impact), and maybe even didn’t collaborate with anyone to handle distribution / hosting etc, but if that software is used by others there is always support, training and marketing to consider.  You can create a todo app for yourself without talking to anyone.  But nobody makes a career in this business without talking to other humans.</p>\n<p>The thing about us humans; we work well with people who we trust, and who we perceive as caring about us.  We also are for the most part exceptionally good at discerning when somebody is faking it.  So if we can’t get away from humans, and we can’t be fake, what can we do?  We are left with, in the words of Dale Carnegie “becoming genuinely interested in other people”.  If you’re currently filled with red-faced frustration at your annoying co-worker or manipulative boss, this may seem like asking for a miracle. And arguably any time we look outside ourselves it is a miracle. But regardless of your philosophical outlook on such things, there are definitely ways we can improve in how we work with and care for the people around us.  And it starts with trying to empathize and seeing the people around us as human beings and not obstacles or tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Iiooe4\">How To Win Friends And Influence People - Dale Carnegie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YSZasy\">Radical Candor - Kimball Scott</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WVkqfv\">I Hear You - Michael Sorenson</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5. Negotiation &#x26; Persuasion</h4>\n<p>You may not think that Software Engineering involves much negotiation.  But that is only true if you use a shallow definition of negotiation.  Every time a team debates implementation strategies for a feature, which tickets should end up in a sprint, and how much time to spend chasing a difficult to reproduce bug, they are engaging in negotiation, and team members are attempting to persuade.  And there is a wealth of knowledge out there describing how to improve on these skills.</p>\n<p>A word of caution here; unlike some of the other things on this list, these skills can often be dangerous when they’re improved in isolation.  When developers complain about politics trumping technical ability, they’re often experiencing decisions being made based on the ability of some employees to persuade and negotiate.  When those employees are not actually providing the best ideas this is suboptimal.  For the technically skilled employees, the answer is to learn to persuade better.  But for those who can negotiate we always need to make sure that we’re <strong>persuading for good</strong>.  Just like the loudest voices shouldn’t always win, when you can communicate well, make sure to stay humble and  boost other’s good ideas when you see them.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OUBnnl\">Negotiation Genius - Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6. Continual Learning</h4>\n<p>Were you paying attention in high school physics when they taught about the difference between distance, velocity, and acceleration?  Distance is the amount an object has traveled.  Velocity is the speed at which it is currently moving in a given direction.  Acceleration is the rate at which the object’s velocity is changing.  If you want to know where an object is <em>right now</em>, distance is the only thing that matters.  But as time progresses, velocity starts to matter more, and in the very long term any difference in acceleration will be the only thing that matters.</p>\n<p>The same ideas play out when acquiring skills.  If you need to evaluate your career potential for the next few months, the skills and accomplishments you’ve acquired so far (distance) are the only things that matter.  But if you want to think about your career potential over the next 30 years, the new skills you’re acquiring (velocity) and even more importantly your ability to get better at learning new things (acceleration) will matter much much more. Learning is a skill unto itself, and the earlier you invest in it the more dividends it will pay over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/\">Learning To Learn - Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js\">How To Keep Learning JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>7. Self Care</h4>\n<p>Another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way in my career is the reality of my own mortality.  None of us are indestructible, and our bodies are not perpetual energy machines.  They require care and maintenance.  Our souls too are not meant to run on work alone, and we can burn out hard without sufficient rest.  This is all aside from deeper issues of disease and mental health that can change our lives in even more profound and difficult ways.</p>\n<p>Self care is a career skill because frankly we are great at deluding ourselves into thinking we’re functioning normally while we’ve compromised ourselves.  <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2014/07/you-might-not-know-if-youre-sleep-deprived.html\">Research</a> shows that we are horrible judges of whether our judgement and creativity are compromised by lack of sleep.  Because we can’t run controlled studies on ourselves, we don’t really know whether our lack of exercise or 60 hour workweek induced burnout are hurting our creativity.  But research suggests it is for pretty much everybody.</p>\n<p>Healthy socialization, sleeping, eating and exercise ultimately lead to better emotional stability, ability to focus, and creativity.  But even aside from the career benefits, when we’re devouring our bodies and minds for work, it leads to a question of what we’re doing this for in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OVBpvx\">Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work &#x26; The Common Rule</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>8. Business Awareness</h4>\n<p>Do you know what your company actually does?  Do you understand why the features you’re building are important, and the relative priority of them?  Can you explain the business tradeoffs involved when you’re making an software architecture decision between performance and security?</p>\n<p>In companies larger than a few people it’s not ultimately developers’ jobs to make business decisions.  But understanding the context for those decisions helps us better prioritize our time, make good tradeoffs, and call attention to inefficiencies or counterproductive behavior in our products. In addition, nobody wants to spend time working on things that don’t matter. But when we try to innovate without understanding the broader business, we often end up doing just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology\">Choose Boring Technology - Dan McKinley</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>9. Marketing and Branding</h4>\n<p>Marketing is a dirty word in engineering circles.  Many take the attitude of the Dilbert comics that <a href=\"https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-05-02\">marketing is a synonym for exaggeration lying, and fraud</a>.  But at it’s core marketing is just making sure that the people who could benefit from your services are aware of those services.  This has several applications to developers.  In the job market, finding ways to let employers know who you are and what you’re capable of is important.  But in medium to large companies it also is important to do some level of internal marketing; to make sure you’re credited for the work you’ve done and that people understand it’s values.  Developers who consider themselves above this or dismiss it as politics do so at their own peril.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/single-post/2019/02/17/7-Common-Content-Marketing-Mistakes-Developers-Make-and-How-to-Avoid-Them\">7 Common Content Marketing Mistakes Developers Make and How to Avoid Them - Stephanie Morillo</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>10. Character</h4>\n<p>The final item here is in some ways an oddball.  While the other 9 things on this list are skills that you can work on, character is something deeper.  Questions of what good character is and how you develop it are way outside the scope of this post.  And I would personally consider any attempt to improve your character for solely utilitarian career reasons to be ultimately hollow.  But character is undeniably important in your career.</p>\n<p>Do the people around you trust you?  Do they believe that you’re trying to do the right thing?  If the answers are no, you may find obstacles in the most unexpected places.  If the answers are yes, you will eventually find help from people you would never have looked to.</p>\n<p>In addition, as an industry, technology has the power to shape the world, and as practitioners we all get the chance to impact our little corners of the world.  It’s worth considering not just whether we’re “succeeding in our career”, but what impact we’re having on the world around us.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2I5jP7K\">Future Ethics - Cennydd Bowles</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/15/soft-skills"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"adequate-talk,fe-concerns,favorite-interview","topics":["career","leadership","productivity"],"category":"soft-skills","key":"importance-of-writing","title":"The Importance of Writing For Software Developers","description":"Why your ability to write will shape your career","layout":"post","path":"/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing","date":"2019/03/02","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities</p>\n<p>- <em>Me, Christmas 2018</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think I caught my sister in law by surprise a bit when I answered her questions about the importance of writing in my job that way.  She’s an assistant professor who teaches writing to college students, and has found that her students pursuing technical degrees generally fail to see the value in learning to write.  The contrast between their expectations and my perspective after a decade working in software was strong.  I promised her at the time that I’d write down some thoughts on why writing skills are valuable for software engineers.  So here it is, 6 reasons that writing skills are crucial for working in the tech industry<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h4>1. You will write every day</h4>\n<p>Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside.  One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.  Here are a few types of writing that I’ve done daily or weekly for the last decade:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussing technical implementations through chat apps like slack</li>\n<li>Writing Bug Reports</li>\n<li>Writing comments in my code and technical documentation to help others and my future self understand what was done</li>\n<li>Writing reviews of other developers code to help our team improve and coordinate on best practices</li>\n<li>Answering questions from less technical employees or clients, often through email or slack.</li>\n<li>Creating design documents for complex work during planning times</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That list is illustrative but not exhaustive.  Any software engineer who wishes to build software that is used by others will end up doing plenty of writing.</p>\n<h4>2. The ability to explain complex topics will set you apart</h4>\n<p>The ability to take a complex topic and explain it in terms that somebody who doesn’t have all the background you do can understand is a critical one for software engineers.  This can help negate two of the most frustrating experiences for a developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A business asking for work that doesn’t make sense because the business folks don’t understand how the product works</li>\n<li>Less experienced members of the the team routinely making mistakes and breaking things because they don’t understand how the product works</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Senior engineers who can explain and document complex pieces of software save everyone frustration by helping junior members of the team understand how things work and be more productive, and by aligning business expectations and plans to the reality of how their software systems actually work.  These are hugely valuable activities that can make a big difference in your career.</p>\n<h4>3. Writing will help you find a (better) job</h4>\n<p>When I’ve interviewed software engineers, I see a variety of problems: they fail to present their strengths, don’t manage to show a sincere interest in the job, and get caught flat-footed on fairly standard questions.  Most of these mistakes come down to a lack of preparation, not tailoring their message to their audience, and not knowing how to structure the information they know about themselves in a compelling way.  These are the skills that you’ll learn from a good class on writing, and develop through practice writing.</p>\n<p>Interviews are important, especially early on in your career.  Your compensation as you go throughout your career tends to be anchored to where you started, especially if you stay one place for a long time.  An increase of $5,000 in salary on a job you take today would mean an additional $92,000 of accumulated income over the next 15 years assuming a salary increase rate of 3% a year<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition if you write publicly on a blog like this, it can help you show proof of your knowledge in a way that a resume never will.  Not everybody needs to be publicly blogging, but if that appeals to you it can be a great career booster.</p>\n<h4>4. Remote work increases the importance of writing</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest trends in the tech industry these days is the <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/remote-workforce-rise/\">rise of remote work</a>. More teams are embracing partial remote work, and there are major companies like Buffer, Invision and GitLab that are entirely remote.  Remote work is partially enabled by video chat technology, but written communication is the lifeblood of a successful remote team. Collaborating via tools like Slack, Github, Trello and Jira is part of most teams’ workflows, but when everybody is remote, being able to express yourself clearly on these platforms is critical.</p>\n<h4>5. Your career trajectory will depend on your ability to influence and persuade</h4>\n<p>Most developers when they begin their first software job will be given a set of tasks to do and the expectation is that they will create work to the spec that somebody else has designed.  They are implementors.  But as a developers career progresses there is an opportunity to be more than an implementor.  Since developers understand the system best, they often have ideas that can help shape product designs.  Developers also often need to work with other teams whose goals may not be completely aligned with their team.  These are not situations where even a senior engineer is likely to have direct authority.  Instead the developers who continue to grow in their careers are those who are able to influence and persuade without authority.</p>\n<p>This is again a skill that writing classes can cultivate.  Persuasive writing practice can help give you the clarity of thought and intuition for structuring arguments that will help both when you’re trying to make a point through writing or doing it verbally.</p>\n<h4>6. Writing skills translate to writing code</h4>\n<p>This last one is really specific to software engineering, but I’ve found that applying writing principles to code has helped me write more maintainable code.  Most code written in a professional context will be read many times by other people (or by the original author after they have long lost track of their original context).  Being able to write code that can be understood by both a computer and by human beings is a skill developed over time, but many of the same “brain muscles” that you develop in writing prose can be applied to code: it’s important to know your audience, structure your information in a logical manner, and use judgement when finding just the right phrase (or code structure) for a situation.  That could be a whole post in itself.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">I write based on the tech industry and software development specifically because that is what I have lived, but most of these points should be equally applicable to any engineering career and would likely require very little modification for science and research as well.<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">Ok real world promotion rates in the tech industry are likely to be choppier than that, but the example holds.<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"soft-skills,herding-lions,meetings-concurrency","topics":["leadership","management"],"category":"eng-management","key":"management-resources-2-years","title":"The Management Resources I Keep Coming Back To","description":"Ideas that have shaped my approach to management","layout":"post","path":"/2020/07/25/management-resources-2-years","date":"2020/07/25","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Although I don’t read Hacker News much these days, I do subscribe to <a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">a newsletter</a> that rounds up the best links every week, and there are almost always one or two gems in there.</p>\n<p>This week my favorite link was this roundup of <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/\">Essays on Programming I Think About A lot</a> by Ben Kuhn, cataloguing essays on the internet that he comes back to or references repeatedly.</p>\n<p>I’m now ~2 years into managing people and because <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90282088/why-being-a-manager-is-a-career-change-not-a-promotion\">Engineering Management is not a promotion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time leading up to that change and since reading about management in an attempt to avoid being completely clueless at my job<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Like Ben, I have a few key essays and books that I reference and go back to over and over again.

But it’s important to be aware of the other styles/approaches available in your leadership toolbox. A strong leader understands that different styles can be valuable when an environment or situation calls for it. As Herminia Ibarra says in my <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\">favorite article</a> on this subject, “Small changes—in the way we carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact—often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup/\">Taste The Soup | Rands</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a meeting where an individual or team is presenting a complex idea or project, my job as the leader is soup tasting. It’s sampling critical parts of the idea to get a sense of how this soup has been or will be made. Who are the critical people? What are the critical parts? Which decisions matter? I don’t know. I do believe that a pre-requisite for leadership is that you have experience. You’ve had trials which have resulted in both impressive successes and majestic failures. These aggregate lessons define your metaphoric soup tasting ability, and when your team brings you a topic to review, it is this experience you apply to ask the critical soup questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/\">Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder | Charity Majors</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you like engineering management, your tendency is to go “cool, now I’m a manager”, and move from job to job as an engineering manager, managing team after team of engineers.  But this is a trap.  It is not a sound long term plan.  It leads too many people off to a place they never wanted to end up: technically sidelined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lethain.com/values-oasis/\">Trapped in a Values Oasis | Will Larson</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rule of thumb here is to lead through ambiguity, and advocate through disagreement.\nIt’s important to diagnose your situation correctly, because when you get it wrong, it’ll still feel like you’re making progress, but it’s wholly dependent on you and it’s progress that is likely to come at the cost of undermining both you and your team within the broader organization. It can be extraordinarily frustrating to “disagree and commit” to a policy or value that goes against your personal values, but any worthwhile measure of successful leadership needs to consider your team’s success more highly than your own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://kellanem.com/notes/friday-wins\">Friday Wins &#x26; A Case Study in Ritual Design | Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Culture is what you celebrate.

You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. You don’t want that person or the rest of the team to think you’re a jerk. Plus, you’ve been told since you learned to talk, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Now all of a sudden it’s your job to say it. You’ve got to undo a lifetime of training. Management is hard.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best thing I’ve read on how to give feedback well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2D4btMb\">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hard truth is, bad meetings almost always lead to bad decisions, which is the best recipe for mediocrity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of this book is focused on very specific advice for specific types of meetings, but the philosophical takeaway it left me with was much simpler; meetings aren’t non-negotiable things that we all must endure.

You can see this in project estimation, where engineers often resist providing any estimate since “it’s hard to tell before we actually build it”.  You can see it in product planning, where teams I’ve worked with struggle to provide clear usage or business impact goals since “it is hard to tell how impactful this will be till we build it”.</p>\n<p>Hubbard’s advice for making properly calibrated estimates would probably help in multiple places in the software world:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use 90% confidence intervals when there’s uncertainty, not point estimates or vague categories like “medium risk”</strong> - Saying a piece of software work is “large” is much less actionable and informative than “we’re 90% confident that it will take between 3 and 15 days to complete.</li>\n<li><strong>Use absurd scenarios and alternative bets to calibrate a confidence interval</strong> - You may think you have no idea how long a novel new software project will take, but even for projects with high uncertainty this is untrue.  You can start by asking questions like “is there any chance this will be done tomorrow” and “is there any chance this project will take more than 5 years”.  If the answer is no, then you’ve established a baseline confidence interval, and you can start working inward from there.  When you get to the point that something is feasible if unlikely, its a sign that you’re probably near the 90% confidence interval<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  Once you have a starting place, you can further consider a hypothetical bet where you had to choose between a lottery with a 90% payout of $1000 and a scenario where you got the $1000 when the item ended in your range.  If you would clearly prefer one of those scenarios to the other, your range is probably too tight or too loose.</li>\n<li><strong>Model your estimates with simple monte carlo simulations</strong> - Hubbard recommends using Monte Carlo simulations (picking random numbers according to the distributions set up by your confidence intervals ~1000 times) in order to get a better intuition of what real world outcomes might look like.  Doing this right does mean understanding not just the confidence range, but also what the distribution looks like.  Estimating simple software feature work for instance, is likely not a normal distribution.  Many tasks will be straightforward and be completed quickly, but we’ll hit occasional tasks that require significant restructuring of a program to complete.  It’s a classic “long tail” scenario.</li>\n<li><strong>Break down estimates into component parts</strong> - One of the most powerful techniques for making better estimates under uncertainty is “Fermi Decomposition”, the process of breaking an estimation problem into smaller estimation problems (which may be more tractable) and then combining the estimate.  In software this can mean breaking up a large project into the component pieces of work and then estimating those.  Doing this right of course means capturing our uncertainty on the sub-estimates, so that we can roll that up into the larger estimate.  If we optimistically point estimate every element of a project, we’re going to end up with a total estimate that is actually less likely, since we need <em>everything</em> to go well to hit that total estimate.  I commonly see engineers handle this by doing optimistic estimates and then adding a buffer period.  It would be better to be clear about uncertainty and do your decompositions with a range of values (although it does make sense to factor in uncertainty about tasks that may be missing).</li>\n<li><strong>Consider what measurements will be valuable</strong> - When we start viewing our estimation goal as reducing uncertainty rather than eliminating it, its easier to see that some easy measurements might go a long way toward improving our projections, even if they won’t take us to an exact value.  For instance if we want to know how many tickets we might close during an upcoming sprint, it can be easy to say that there’s no way to know.  The new work is unique and isn’t necessarily directly comparable to work we’ve done in the past.  However just because we can’t make an exact projection doesn’t mean we know nothing.  If we look at our last 10 sprints and see how many tasks we completed in each of them, we can feel confident that this upcoming sprint is likely to be between the minimum and maximum value in that range, or at least close.

It’s a common sentiment that has some truth but usually will make a manager start laughing or crying if you suggest that it represents reality.  Managing people well involves very little imposing your will on a situation and a lot more driving change indirectly.  The good news is that most of the techniques for this type of indirect change not only can be used by non-managers, many of them are actually more effective coming from engineers directly.  A lot of these techniques deserve posts of their own and I intend to keep these short, so consider this a brainstorming list for the next time you want to change something on your team and don’t feel empowered to do so.</p>\n<h3>Build the thing you want to exist</h3>\n<p>A software engineer’s ultimate power move is the ability to create new things.  If you’re in an argument on the best path forward for a project, just going ahead and building the thing you think should exist can be incredibly powerful.  This could be a proof of concept for larger things, or the full thing for smaller features.  Opposition and bikeshedding often melts away in the face of a working example of the future.  This is especially effective if the argument has been about whether your preferred solution is possible.</p>\n<p>Note that this path can be overused, is helped along by a gentle touch, and I wouldn’t recommend it if you put so much time and effort into it that you’d be crushed if people still said no.  But it is a powerful way to move discussions forward.</p>\n<h3>Make it easier</h3>\n<p>Do you want everybody to write more/better tests?  Create some best practice examples and documentation.  Maybe make some training videos showing how you write tests.  Write some helpers to encompass common testing patterns.  Make sure your testing tools are updated to versions with the latest features, and consider whether there are different tools you can use to make adoption easier.  This type of work is also great for establishing yourself as an expert in the area (see below).</p>\n<h3>Make your preference a default</h3>\n<p>Similar to making it easier, you can often change behavior simply by making it the path of least resistance.  Want people to use spaces instead of tabs?  Encode that into a linter and set it to run against every Pull Request.  Want to make sure people add information to new issues?  Create an issue template.  Humans are very susceptible to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3930gJz\">nudges</a> and default behaviors, and are much more willing to accept new behaviors when they don’t require conscious action from them.</p>\n<h3>Identify allies and opponents</h3>\n<p>If you want to change behavior in your team, it can be helpful to have multiple people fighting for a change.  A great place to start here is just identifying who agrees with you.  Not everyone who is willing to accept a change might want to fight for it as much as you, but establishing an understanding of where people stand is helpful for you to identify potential allies as well as people who you may have to work harder to convince.</p>\n<p>When you know who <em>disagrees</em> with you, those people can actually be the most helpful in helping you move a change forward if they’re willing to give clear feedback, since they’ll help establish the conditions under which a team might accept a change.</p>\n<p>If you find that you’re primarily fighting apathy rather than opposition, it can be a good time to pivot to other methods like “making it a default” or “show the future”.</p>\n<h3>Show the future</h3>\n<p>In his 1936 classic <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oZu7Yx\">How To Win Friends and Influence People</a>, Dale Carnegie said that one of the fundamental techniques in working with people was “Arouse in the other person an eager want”.  When we want to drive forward a change and are faced with apathy, often times the issue is that other people don’t understand why the change we’re advocating would be valuable for them.</p>\n<p>A great technique in this case is to be crystal clear on what we expect to get from the change — and to do so in a way that resonates with them.  If we want to have more automated tests, we might explain to our fellow engineers that more tests can help prevent future rolled back releases, resulting in less crunch time work.  Meanwhile, our product manager might be more interested to know that it will result in fewer angry customers and missed deadlines due to rework.</p>\n<p>It’s important not to oversell here.  If you make it sound like adding a few tests will remove all quality issues with your product this route can backfire with the team quickly dropping support when the initial results underwhelm.  But understanding and explaining the “why” in a way that resonates with every relevant teammate is a powerful technique.</p>\n<h3>Ask authentic questions</h3>\n<p>When you are looking to change things and it feels like you’re the only one who sees the value in what you’re doing a great place to start can be asking authentic questions of others.  For instance, if we went back to our testing example you might ask “Do you think writing more tests would be valuable?”, “why do you think we don’t write more tests now”, or “how do you think our test suite should evolve from here?“.</p>\n<p>If asked sincerely those questions will help you refine your understanding of the challenge in front of you, will open the minds of the people you’re asking toward the challenge, and may win some converts just by including people.  The sincerely part is important here though - people can generally tell when you’re actually listening to what they have to say versus including perfunctory “feedback requests” on your way to pushing an agenda.</p>\n<h3>Work in “public”</h3>\n<p>When you’re trying to encourage a particular practice it can be helpful to demonstrate the work “in public”.  So if you want people writing more tests, share screenshares of yourself writing tests, run a brown bag lunch where you do some live coding, or share your test PRs in a public slack channel where people will see it.  You might even write public blog posts about the work you’re doing, or speak about it at a meetup.</p>\n<p>There are a few goals here: to show people what it looks like to do the work, to “normalize” the practice, and to give it visibility.  Doing work publically like this can be a way to attract other interested folks who you might not have expected to be sympathetic, it can raise your own profile, and it can be a way to get great feedback.</p>\n<h3>Explain your work</h3>\n<p>One mistake I see people who are trying to drive change make is an assumption that everybody understands what they’re doing.  When you’re first introducing a new technology, process, or improvement to your team you should always assume that you need to make the case for it, starting with clearly explaining what the change is and what you’re intending to accomplish with it.</p>\n<p>This technique can be combined with many of the other ones here, and can be accomplished in many ways.  A short RFC style document where you outline the change you want can be great.  Putting extra detailed comments and descriptions into pull requests where you’re implementing a desired change can be helpful, as can screencasts, blog posts, or brown bags.  For smaller changes this may just mean going out of your way to be extra explicit about the “why” when you make pull request comments requesting people to move in a certain direction.</p>\n<h3>Establish your expertise</h3>\n<p>As I said at the beginning, “change by authority” is not generally the best path.  People are happier doing things because they see the value, not because somebody told them to do so.  That said, sometimes change does need to come through authority.  When that is the case though, there are two types of relevant authority in most engineering organizations.  Hierarchical authority (IE directives from somebody with a managerial title above you in a reporting relationship) and expertise authority.  While hierarchical authority changes slowly and comes with all sorts of other pros and cons, anyone can develop the authority of expertise with a level of dedication and work.</p>\n<p>If you want to drive testing culture on your team it can be helpful to establish yourself as an expert on testing.  The bar for this might be quite high or quite low depending on your existing culture, but the path is similar either way; do the work consistently over time, educate yourself, and demonstrate the impact of the work you’re doing.  A little bit of this might not go very far, and if the organization explicitly doesn’t value the change you’re trying to make it is possible that expertise won’t change the equation here.  But if there is willingness to consider growth, establishing yourself as an expert will ensure that you will be part of the conversations when it is time to make a change, and you’ll get to contribute to making change happen.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/01/19/driving-change-without-authority"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"team-output-productivity,play-other-positions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"good-meetings-are-designed","title":"Good Meetings Are Designed Not Born","description":"You don't need to endure bad meetings","layout":"post","path":"/2021/11/03/good-meetings-are-designed","date":"2021/11/03","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>This article was first published in my newsletter, <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/\">Herding Lions</a></em></p>\n<p>There’s something deeply human about wanting to excel at the work we find ourselves doing. When we aspire to be effective at our jobs, how we describe and understand the key concepts in our work matters a lot. Last week <a href=\"/2021/10/27/team-output-productivity\">I talked about having a better model for productivity</a> — measuring productivity at the team rather than the individual level can cause significant change in what we choose to work on and the environment we create for our teammates. This week I want to consider the beliefs we have around meetings. Do you believe that bad meetings are just an inevitable cost of the working world that we all must endure? Or can we work to create better meetings?</p>\n<p>I didn’t think very much about meetings early in my career; I just showed up where I was told, when I was told. Sometimes meetings were interesting, sometimes I just sat and waited for them to be over. For the especially long and irrelevant meetings, I learned that people didn’t object to me “taking notes” on my laptop, and I soon learned how to tune out without anyone caring.</p>\n<p>As I moved into the startup world and began to care more about my work though, I started to get into more meetings that were genuinely interesting to me, and bad meetings started to bother me more. When I began learning about management and taking more leadership, I read more about the theory behind meetings and started paying closer attention to what worked and didn’t in meetings. What I learned is that good meetings are designed, not born. It’s possible to have meetings that are good experiences for everyone involved, but it takes intentionality.</p>\n<p>There are 4 levers I use when designing a meeting: choosing the audience, crafting the agenda, picking the right cadence, and shifting aspects async.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong> - Meetings without key decision makers or subject matter experts often end without conclusions, and decisions can get overturned quickly afterwards. On the flip side, while it may feel kind to invite anyone interested to a meeting, a meeting with too many people can become chaotic, waste people’s time, or stifle contribution if some people aren’t comfortable being open and honest in front of the full group for reasons of timidity, confidentiality, or simply unfamiliarity with the participants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Agenda</strong>- Coming into a meeting with a clear agenda doesn’t always lead to a great experience, but without one it’s pretty much impossible to guarantee a well run meeting. A thoughtful agenda sets a direction for a meeting, makes goals clear and helps people prepare. Written agendas are great, but a simple verbal “the goal for this meeting is” at the beginning of a less formal meeting can go a long way. It’s never too late to reset everybody towards a plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Cadence</strong> - Should a meeting occur daily? Weekly? Monthly? On an as needed / ad hoc basis? This decision has a big impact on a meetings tone and impact. Set this too regularly and you’ll find you’re wasting people’s time and losing engagement. Too spread apart and you might not really be accomplishing your goals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Async</strong> - We’ve all been in a classic “could have been an email” meeting. But even for meetings that clearly do merit time together, it’s worth asking if parts of it can be split out async. Maybe updates can go into Slack while we meet to talk about strategic discussions or open problems. Maybe instead of demoing a new design and then discussing it in a meeting, a designer could send a video of the design, take some async comments and then meet to discuss the more controversial aspects of the design that weren’t fleshed out in comments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process for designing a meeting with these levers is straightforward. Break down what needs to be accomplished (goals), identify the audience for each goal, consider whether a goal can be fully or partially accomplished async, figure out the cadence for the meeting(s), and then write an agenda for each meeting you’re creating.</p>\n<p>My single most important meeting design advice is never start with a meeting, start with your goals. Some of the worst meetings are those that try to do 5 things poorly rather than 1 or 2 things well. When you start by breaking down and defining what you want to accomplish, it becomes much easier to pick the right audience, agenda and cadence for your goals. For instance I was recently part of a weekly cross-org meeting that was attempting to push forward tactical code level changes as well as serve as an announcement/discussion place for important strategic announcements. Attendance was poor and the meetings were often low on engagement. The organizers were able to greatly improve this meeting by identifying and breaking apart these goals, shifting to 2 meetings: a monthly strategic meetings for managers and a weekly tactical meeting for engineers involved in the initiatives.</p>\n<p>Once you have a set of goals, you should figure out the audience for each one. If the audiences of your goals are sufficiently different, consider splitting your goals across multiple meetings or async mediums rather than trying to cram them into a single meeting. Even if it feels inefficient for you as an organizer, it can greatly streamline the process and bring better outcomes for everyone as in the above example. If your goals all need roughly the same audience, just think carefully about who really needs to be included. There’s a lot of value in keeping information open, sponsoring folks for opportunities, and listening to all voices. However there’s a delicate balance between pursuing those goals and inviting chaos or wasting people’s time. If you’re having trouble cutting a meeting, consider inviting a smaller group but sending the minutes to a larger one to keep them in the loop, or workshopping a proposal with a small group and then presenting it to a different group of stakeholders.</p>\n<p>At this point you should be able to see if you really need a meeting or whether your goals can be accomplished async, and what their cadence should be. Sometimes some goals may need a meeting while others can be handled async. For instance when we redesigned my team’s standups last year we determined that our “individual status updates” could be handled async through Slack, and the purpose of our standup Zooms would be connecting as a team, checking in on project status with a quick confidence check and an open floor for people to discuss issues and blockers. This allowed us to remove some boilerplate from the meeting discussion, honored my team’s desire to have more dedicated “team time” during the pandemic, and led to deeper and more relevant discussions. When in doubt I recommend starting with something happening async until it proves that it needs a meeting. If you do believe you need to meet in person consider starting with meetings scheduled on a case by case basis rather than immediately jumping into a recurring cadence. You’ll get a sense of how often the meeting is relevant.</p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to have an agenda. If you’ve started with goals this is easier. Each goal covered by a meeting should be an agenda item. I’m currently running a daily project check in sync where we determined the goals were to make sure we stayed on track, make sure we were working tightly together across roles, and quickly resolve blockers as they arose. As a result the agenda for that meeting is a 2 minute review of our progress against project tickets in Jira, an open time for developers and our designer to demo any new updates to the team as they complete work, and then a period for raising blockers or issues for the team to discuss and hopefully resolve. Each section of the meeting is directly connected to a goal so the agenda was easy to write. For one off or informal meetings you may not have a written agenda, but I still recommend that you call out the goals as you start the meeting, and circle back at the end to make sure you’ve addressed each goal. This practice has made a big difference for me in terms of running effective meetings.</p>\n<p>The quality of a meeting isn’t the result of a dice roll. You can make a meeting better with planning. Take the time to do it.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/11/03/good-meetings-are-designed"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"what-do-ems-do,play-other-positions,change-without-authority","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"ems-handling-accountability","title":"Engineering Management: Handling Accountability","description":"Owning results when you're not doing the work","layout":"post","path":"/2021/02/23/ems-handling-accountability","date":"2021/02/23","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>I’m currently taking some time away from my job on parental leave, and it seemed like a good time to reflect on the lessons I’ve learned the last few years about engineering management, this is my third post, you can see a list of past posts on the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/engineering-management-thoughts\">series page</a></em></p>\n<p>When moving into an engineering manager role, one of the toughest transitions for me was mentally adjusting from being responsible for tasks and projects that I owned to being accountable for the output of a team.  As I discussed in <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do\">What Engineering Managers Do</a>, I like using Andy Grove’s definition of a manager’s output: the output of their team as well as the output of any teams that they’re influencing.  Manager’s thus bring value by improving those outputs.  This potentially allows you as a manager to have a much larger sphere of impact than an individual contributor working on a single project at a time.  But it also means that you will be held accountable for actions that you may not have had direct control over.  This can be distressing for new EMs (it was for me!) as you realize that “working harder when things go wrong” may no longer be a viable strategy for avoiding failures.</p>\n<p>The first time a manager gets negative feedback for work that wasn’t personally in their control it is tempting to prevent it in the future by micromanaging or using themselves as a safety net.  Micromanaging has a horrible reputation, but it is actually a very natural reaction for engineers who are used to competently completing tasks and then being praised for it who face criticism when a task they know they could complete is not done adequately.  It is a very human response at this point to say “well I know how to do that, let’s make sure you’re doing it the way I would”.  When that is repeated over time it leads to the familiar and awful rhythm of low trust between the manager and teammate, low initiative from the teammate and frustratingly slow progress.</p>\n<p>Acting as a safety net for employees is a more subtle task for managers.  They may know they don’t want to micromanage, but instead they might choose to tackle the complex, likely-to-fail parts of a task themselves, or perform a “diving save” taking over a project when it looks like it might not complete successfully.  This appears better than micro-management — employees have ownership of their work, at least until it goes off the rails.  But it leads to many of the same issues as pure micromanagement: employees who don’t grow because they’re not learning to do the hard work themselves, a disconnection from consequences that means a lack of ownership from the team, and a lack of trust that will eventually erode morale.  Like micromanagement though, this approach doesn’t scale.  You and your team will both be locked to a limited amount of responsibility that is based on your capacity as a manager to be in the details of everything.  Growing as a leader and a team requires a different approach.</p>\n<p>The only solution for handling accountability that scales is developing a high performing team.  It isn’t a problem to be held responsible for the output of a group that you trust and believe in.  And high performing teams have a tendency to generate new leaders, allowing you to do less and/or focus on higher level work and grow your career. But creating a team like that requires effort and humility over time.  This means as managers we have to be willing to take some short term failures.</p>\n<p>While your team is in a growth stage (any of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development\">forming, storming, norming steps in a group’s development</a>) you’ll need to expect that their output will not always meet your individual standards.  There are a few things you can do to mitigate this from an accountability perspective.</p>\n<p>Firstly it is important to match your expectation setting and commitments to your team’s maturity.  If you’re not confident that a team can make a commitment without you doing the work yourself, don’t sign on for the work.  And certainly try to limit the number of simultaneous challenging projects you’re taking on so that you can focus on enabling your team when you do have challenges.  This may sound naive and frustrating to people who feel they <em>have</em> to take on the work.  The key thing to understand are that you can’t do this forever — eventually the team has to grow it’s capacity to something the organization can accept, or either you or your management is failing.  But in most circumstances it’s better to give an honest no up front than make excuses for a failed project 3 months down the road.  There are organizations which won’t reward that calculus — in which case you should probably document your concerns and continue anyway, hopefully developing some credibility for the next such discussion.</p>\n<p>When you’re in this type of growth stage, it’s also important to understand the impact of the work that is coming in.  I like the analogy that <a href=\"https://davidnovakleadership.com/blog/crystal-vs-rubber/\">Gregg Dedrick shares here</a> of juggling crystal and rubber balls.  Some tasks are like crystal balls — if you drop them there are expensive consequences and no second chances.  But most tasks are more like rubber balls.  If you drop one you’ll get to pick it up and try again.  It’s important to understand which are which.  If your growing team is being asked to pick up crystal ball tasks it’s important to exercise caution.  This is where it’s extra important to be clear about your team’s capacity, and is a case where it may be appropriate to get more involved personally to ensure success.  Of course if most of the tasks coming your way seem like crystal balls, it’s worth digging into that more and understanding what is driving that, and if some of them are actually more droppable than you think.</p>\n<p>As your team grows you’ll be able to start shifting the work you take on and saying yes to more things.  At this point it’s important to nurture the ownership that your team is feeling.  Be generous with credit for successes while continuing to own accountability for failures.  Within the team, make sure you are holding high standards and giving clear feedback when needed.  Nothing undercuts an empowered team like somebody who isn’t contributing at the level of the rest of the team and isn’t held accountable for that.  That said, leave room for failures to continue happening.  Even high performing teams have room to grow, so the principles for a growing team still apply — let people take on rubber ball tasks that are a stretch,</p>\n<h2>Accountability for a high performing empowered team</h2>\n<p>Managing a team that feels ownership of their work and is growing into higher levels of capability is more rewarding, less stressful, more educational, and more powerful for your career than micromanaging.  It’s also ultimately morally good — you’re creating an environment where other people can thrive and use their gifts and abilities.</p>\n<h3>More Engineering Management Posts</h3>\n<p>This is part of a series of posts on Engineering Management.

Every engineering team I’ve ever seen has more opportunities than capacity, and leaders can always do more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. <strong>I am never done</strong>. - Andy Grove</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below are 4 lessons I’ve learned about using time well during my time as a manager.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Time is your primary resource as a manager, and it is finite</strong>. The Andy Grove quote above is challenging. When we can always do more, there aren’t natural boundaries that tell us when to stop. For individual contributors this can get managed without much intention through the rhythms of sprints / projects / the rate that product managers can assign work. EMs tend to be expected to generate their own work and there are fewer natural cues to tell you that you’ve done “enough”. As a result, management tends to be next level time management, and that means you need to start by defining some boundaries (when will you choose to go home and sign off?) and learning to be intentional with your time. A lack of boundaries, or setting your boundaries based on demand in an unbounded way is a sure path to burnout. This is a lesson I’ve had to learn several times personally, as demands on my time have scaled up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be careful with the Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule mindset.</strong> One of the most famous articles on schedule management in tech is <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</a>. In it, Paul Graham breaks down 2 ways of managing your time: manager schedules, where days are neatly divided into hourly blocks, and maker schedules where time is ideally at least in half day uninterrupted blocks (due to the need to do Deep Work / avoid context switching). I think most engineers take the right lesson from this article when they read this and work to protect blocks of time on their calendar better. And many managers empathetically learn from it that they should be considerate of their reports calendars and be careful how they schedule meetings. But there’s a dangerous assumption that people can take from the labels: that once they become a manager, they must be on the manager schedule. Now, plenty of manager’s are on a pure manager’s schedule (I’ve been there). But if you can, working at least partially on a maker’s schedule can unlock a lot more opportunity for creative and strategic work that is difficult to fit into 30 minute blocks scattered throughout your week. The article itself is essentially Graham explaining why he as an “important business person” chooses to operate on a maker schedule against social expectations. So read the article, learn from it, but don’t typecast yourself. Structure your time in the way that lets you have the most impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Run your calendar, don’t let your calendar run you.</strong> On the subject of manager schedules, becoming a manager was the first time in my life I really ran my schedule based off an external calendar, as opposed to primarily relying on my memory for what I needed to do on a day and using calendars and todo lists as a poorly utilized backup plans. Even if you have fewer direct reports and more strategic or technical duties, it’s hart to avoid becoming calendar driven as you move into leadership roles. That said, it’s important to take charge of your calendar, and not let other people structure it for you. That means being judicious about what meetings you accept, and regularly reviewing your recurring meetings for opportunities to prune them, blocking time for strategic and creative work in lengths that allow for deep work and is appropriate to your obligations, and <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-energy-drain/?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#calendar-color-coding-and-defragging\">defragging your calendar</a> to be as efficient as possible. When I’m running on the busier side I’ve also found it helpful to fully block my day the night before the day starts (if it isn’t already) to prevent last second invitations from sapping up prep or break time in my schedule. Your mileage may vary on that depending on how much you culturally feel you need to be available for last second invites. If you do this I recommend explaining it to your direct reports and give them a path to escalate urgent things to you in order to not appear unavailable or “too busy”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clear time to review and improve how you use your time.</strong> The retro is my favorite “agile ritual”, and I think its difficult to overuse for both teams and individuals. One great use for personal retros is a regular review of where your time is going. Most people seem to have a bad intuitive understanding of this, its helpful to do a short term tracking exercise or reconstruct at the end of a week based on your calendar. This is a good time to prune meetings as mentioned above, identify “important but not urgent” work that is falling through the cracks, and also do a <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage\">quick burnout triage</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>When Everything Falls Apart</h3>\n<p>All of the above lessons have been very helpful to me, but I’ve struggled to follow some of them at specific points where I feel completely overwhelmed. So my 4 additional lessons here are patterns that I fallback to when I need to dig my way out of insanity.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do 3 things a day.</strong> I’ve never been great with task management / productivity systems. I’ve wandered through a bunch of tools and patterns without really developing consistent habits. So I may be a poor person to give advice on this topic. However the most effective habit I’ve had, which I’ve picked up multiple times when things have gotten overwhelming is very simple – pick 3 things to do each day, write them down and then try to do them. Limiting myself to 3, not keeping a backlog and writing the 3 things somewhere I can visually see it has helped me focus and make choices when life felt overwhelming. Long term I’m not sure this is an optimal system – the lack of backlog and long term planning can leave blind spots. But it’s simple, productive, and easy to implement, and a great way to build momentum and prioritize when you’re underwater.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distinguish between core work and non-core work</strong> - When things are going well and can feel easy to follow Grove’s advice at the top. I do stuff and then go home. However when you’re juggling 3 plates that are each stacked too high, it can be really hard to know how to stop. At this time it’s very important to draw lines between the essential and nice to have. One dimension I think about with this is core work vs non-core work. There are things I do at work to grow my career, to help others, or just because I’m interested in them. That’s healthy and should be part of my normal rhythms. But in crisis mode it’s important to identify these as things that can be cut down on or dropped. And then actually doing it, even if it’s painful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distinguish between glass and rubber balls.</strong> Similarly, it’s useful to distinguish between glass balls – responsibilities at home or work that won’t come back if you drop them, like being there for a child’s graduation or executing on a career altering project, vs those that we will be able to recover from more easily because there will be more opportunities to make up for it. The distinction between glass and rubber balls will be different for everybody, but Scott Eblin <a href=\"https://eblingroup.com/blog/juggling-rubber-or-glass/?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">has some good advice here for distinguishing the two</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Choose between doing more things acceptably or a few things well.</strong> One of my biggest recent challenges as a manager was learning when my own standards for what “doing my job” were making me less impactful. At a time when I had more on my plate than I could reasonably do well, I made a choice to drop responsibilities where I had a real chance to provide value, because I didn’t think I could perform them to my own standards. That’s a defensible choice, but I didn’t really make it intentionally – instead I freaked out and protected myself. An alternative that I didn’t really consider until I’d gotten to a calmer place was accepting a lower standard of performance (and communicating that expectation to others) in return for being able to keep some projects going without having to disrupt others. Neither of these things are globally the right strategy, it will depend on circumstances and what responsibilities you’re balancing. But making the choice to not just commit to something, but to commit to a maintainable level of quality is an important skill and can help you scale yourself as a manager when under high demand.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/12/14/think-about-time"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"what-do-ems-do,ems-handling-accountability,change-without-authority","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"ems-how-to-delegate","title":"Engineering Management: How To Delegate","description":"How to pass on work successfully","layout":"post","path":"/2021/02/26/ems-how-to-delegate","date":"2021/02/26","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>I’m currently taking some time away from my job on parental leave, and it seemed like a good time to reflect on the lessons I’ve learned the last few years about engineering management. This is my fourth post, you can see a list of past posts on the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/engineering-management-thoughts\">series page</a></em></p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/23/ems-handling-accountability\">last post</a> I discussed the importance of delegating work to your team and giving them room to do important work.  Delegation like this is crucial for effective managers, it’s the only way that you’ll ever have time to grow and it’s the only way that you can help your team grow.  But it isn’t always easy, and effective delegation certainly isn’t as simple as giving somebody a task and walking away.  I’ve picked up a few principles over time on how to delegate well, as well as a few practices that have been helpful for me in finding the right mix of delegation. The principles that have been most helpful for me when delegating work have been to “trust by default”, thinking about people’s ability in terms of “task relevant maturity”, “not being essential”, and “giving objectives and context rather than just tasks”.</p>\n<p>The most important step to beginning delegation is to <strong>trust by default</strong> rather than making people prove themselves before giving them opportunities.  Trusting in this context doesn’t mean blindly handing people arbitrarty work and expecting it to go well.  But it means being willing to give people reasonable stretch opportunities and then properly supporting them through them, and doing that starting early on in your management relationship with them.  Ideally trust will build as you work with a teammate, but if you default to a “prove it” attitude it can be tough for teammates to ever gain your trust.  If this proves difficult for you it may point to a higher level problem like you being too attached to doing work yourself or not having the right people on your team for the work you’re trying to accomplish.  Don’t jump to that last conclusion though — it’s important to look in the mirror first.</p>\n<p>When evaluating people’s ability to handle a task you’re considering delegating to them, you shouldn’t be looking at their title or general track record, but instead focusing on what Andy Grove calls their <strong>task relevant maturity</strong> — how experienced they are at the specific task under discussion.  It’s possible to give brand new employees tasks that are easily within their wheelhouse and very senior team members tasks that are outside of anything they’ve done before.  If you base your support and expectations solely on how senior somebody is or how successfully they’ve handled generic delegated work in the past, you’re likely to mishandle the delegation.</p>\n<p>Adjusting well based on task relevant maturity means giving teammates who have less experience of success with a task more support and monitoring their progress more frequently.  This doesn’t mean micro-managing, but being a resource to the employee, checking in on the task regularly during 1-1s and reviewing any incremental steps in the process for signs that you’ve become misaligned on the objective or that things are off track.  The key is that you’re a support resource and a quality checker, not laying down specific restrictions on how the task is done.  For teammates with progressively more experience with the task you can reduce check-ins and explicit offers of support to match their comfort level, though you should never completely ignore projects or lose track of what is going on with anything important.</p>\n<p>A 3rd principle of delegation is more a warning post that you’re not delegating enough.  <strong>I never want to be essential</strong> for any task as a manager.  If I get hit by a bus or leave the company, my ideal is that everything in the teams reporting to me will hum along perfectly for a long time, with my absence being felt only in lost potential in how I could have helped people grow, or solved higher level problems in the company.  That means that if I see areas where I am <em>essential</em> for success, rather than allowing that to inflate my self importance I should view it as a sign that I need to grow somebody on my team into that role.  If there are people who could be doing it but I’m not giving them the opportunity, it’s time to delegate.  If there’s nobody who can do the work, then it’s a gap on the team that needs to be filled by training or hiring.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s important to delegate at the right level.  Delegating completely defined tasks with a prescribed solution is just asynchronous micro-managing.  Instead you should <strong>delegate objectives, and give people the context they need to make good decisions</strong>. For technical work this can come through in how a Jira ticket or Github issue is written.  Does it describe a technical change that needs to be made without explaining why?  Or does it describe a user problem, with context around what we know about past attempts to solve it or any relevant constraints<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>?  When having a tech lead replace them in an interview, a manager could choose to give them the list of questions they have been asking and ask the tech lead to read from the sheet, or they could explain what they’re looking for in the position, any constraints around what will be accepted by the wider organization, and then have a discussion around the interview questions that the tech lead might want to use.  The second way will engage the tech lead’s brain, give them ownership and maybe help the manager learn something.</p>\n<h3>Practical Activities To Delegate Better</h3>\n<p>It’s good to understand the principles and theory behind delegation, but what if you’re not getting it right in practice?  When I discovered last year that I was not delegating nearly enough, there were 2 activities I went through that helped me do a better job with this: a weekly review and being extra explicit about ownership</p>\n<p>After getting feedback from multiple folks that I was trying to do too much work myself, my first step to getting better was a simple 30 minute <strong>weekly review</strong> where I went through all of my activities from the week and listed out anything I’d spent time on that wasn’t part of what I considered my “core responsibilities”.  From that first list I then considered 2 questions: who else could be doing this work, and are there good reasons why I’m doing it instead?  If you’ve never thought this through before you may find some good low hanging fruit where you’re doing work that somebody else on your team would benefit from doing without a compelling reason.  It’s perfectly fine if many of the things on this list are more complicated though.  There may not be an obvious person for every piece of work, or there may be good reasons why you’re picking it up.  In those cases the goal of the exercise is to bring clarity and give you time to think about what would need to happen to move these tasks to a teammate who would benefit from the work and/or be a more appropriate fit.  Maybe you need to invest in coaching a teammate, have a difficult conversation with a peer about ownership, or just need to document the work so that other people can do it.</p>\n<p>I started this exercise focused on “non-core” work, but scaling yourself as an EM means constantly giving up work and letting others grow into it.  So feel free to consider all of your responsibilities and see if there’s an opportunity for others to grow into some of those while you grow into broader and new opportunities or just get more time back to invest in people.</p>\n<p>Another thing I found helpful when starting to document more was <strong>being explicit about ownership</strong>.  If you have been handling a type of task yourself and want others to step into it, there are benefits to creating a clearly defined role or set of work that you can give somebody.  Without this it can be easy for some piece of the work to fall back to you or be missed.  For instance if you’ve been doing most of the project management on tech projects and want engineers to step into that, it might be helpful to create and document a “project tech lead” position that you assign for each project.  You can then be explicit that the project tech lead is responsible for keeping the project on schedule and identifying or escalating threats to the project plan along with any other duties that make sense.  You can also be explicit about what ways you expect to be supporting a project tech lead and any responsibilities that still fall on you as an EM.</p>\n<h3>Why Delegate?</h3>\n<p>Delegating work well is an incredibly rewarding activity.  You give others opportunities to grow.  You can reduce your own stress and increase your capacity.  You’ll learn from seeing other people take different approaches to work you have done in the past.  Over time this will help create a team that is excited about their work since they’re empowered to do meaningful work and continue growing over time, and it will allow you to continue tackling new challenges as well.  So take some time today to figure out where you can find new places to share your opportunities and create new ones.</p>\n<h3>More Engineering Management Posts</h3>\n<p>This is part of a series of posts on Engineering Management.

This is my fifth post, you can see a list of past posts on the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/engineering-management-thoughts\">series page</a></em></p>\n<p>Giving good feedback to others is a core piece of any manager’s job, but it’s also one that is rarely taught formally.  We all give feedback in some form or other every day: we leave reviews, give compliments, complain, or thank people.  But making the feedback effective is a lot harder, and as a manager it is well worth the effort to consider how you can improve.  Let’s talk about the why, when and how of effective feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The majority of people-related disasters I’ve created originate with my choice to not say the hard thing. On my short list of critical leadership skills, the ability to “say the hard thing” is right after “delegate until it hurts.” - <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/say-the-hard-thing/\">Michael Lopp</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As managers we give feedback because it is <strong>the core way we drive improvement</strong>.  We are not generally <em>doing the work</em>, instead we <em>evaluate the work</em> and give feedback.  That means making it clear to the team when we see things that are or are not working with the end product, the process to build that product or the inner dynamics of the team.  And it means being clear with individuals what is or isn’t working.  Improvement for teams and individuals is a function of practicing the relevant tasks over time with useful feedback loops.  Teams will get some natural feedback loops from the result of their work, peer feedback, and self evaluation but those are unreliable and/or slow.  As a manager you are responsible for making sure that your teammates have tight feedback loops that allow them to understand quickly when things are going off track and correct them, or when they are doing something well and have an opportunity to do even more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“if it hurts, do it more often, and bring the pain forward.” - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PFTySp\">Continuous Delivery</a> by Jez Humble and David Farley</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s important to understand that feedback isn’t something that should happen only at performance reviews — <strong>good feedback is continuous</strong>.  It’s helpful to have regular times for giving and soliciting feedback like a weekly 1-1, but even those should be a backstop — giving feedback directly after you observe a behavior or impact is often the best time.  We want to minimize the <em>feedback loop</em> so that your teammate can respond quickly, and also minimize distance from the event which can often bring skewed memories from both parties.  For those who find giving feedback hard or scary, the idea of doing this regularly might seem overwhelming.  In this case though we can benefit from the devops principle of doing hard things more often.  When feedback is regular and low intensity it can be easier to give and absorb, whereas a mountain of feedback at a performance review can be overwhelming and scary to give.  Early feedback also allows for quicker course correction, hopefully making those difficult review conversations less common.  Performance reviews should never contain surprises, they should just be formalization of an ongoing conversation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Radical Candor” is what happens when you put “Care Personally” and “Challenge Directly” together - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sVHLh2\">Radical Candor by Kim Scott</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sVHLh2\">Radical Candor</a> has influenced my thoughts on feedback more than any other single source, and while the book is worth reading in full, its core idea is easy to summarize: <strong>good feedback comes from caring personally about the individual and being willing to challenge them directly</strong>.  We’ve all dealt with the jerk who is happy to give unfeeling and unwelcome feedback on anything — that’s challenging without caring, what Kim Scott calls “obnoxious agression” in the book.  More common and insiduous though is what she calls “ruinous empathy” and “manipulative insincerity” — caring or not caring without challenging and thus simply avoiding feedback altogether.  The single biggest antipattern around feedback that I’ve seen is choosing to not give it until it is much too late.  People who give good feedback have plenty of empathy and understand the impact of their words — but they also understand how people can be hurt when nobody tells them the truth, so they let that empathy drive them to choose their words carefully and judiciously speak out with courage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Situation-Behavior-Impact method is simple and direct: You capture and clarify the Situation, describe the specific Behaviors observed, and explain the Impact that the person’s behavior had on you. <a href=\"https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-and-impact/\">Center For Creative Leadership</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you’re struggling with how to express a certain piece of feedback it can be helpful to prepare in advance.  I usually benefit from writing down my thoughts and have found the SBI method from the Center For Creative Leadership very helpful here.  <strong>For any feedback you want to give, frame it in terms of the situation (when and where did this happen — any relevant context), the behavior you observed from the person receiving the feedback (what did they do), and the impact on you or that you observed</strong>.  This model is helpful in giving a clear way to write feedback as well as avoiding a bunch of potential traps.  It leads you away from guessing at anyone’s intent or motivations, grounds the feedback in a real situation and behavior, and makes the severity of the feedback clear.  Optionally you can continue to a 4th step — asking the person receiving the feedback what their intention was and giving them a chance to share their thoughts, hopefully leading to a productive 2 way conversation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feedback is a gift - <a href=\"https://marcusblankenship.com/the-art-of-leadership-with-michael-lopp/#:~:text=Feedback%20is%20a%20gift.\">Michael Lopp</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So far in this piece I’ve focused on giving feedback, but it’s important to remember that feedback is a two way street.  <strong>Giving feedback well gets easier when we develop an attitude of curiousity and gratitude when we receive feedback.</strong> Remember that all feedback is a gift — even if some pieces of feedback are easier to work with and better delivered than others.  Creating an environment where others are comfortable giving you feedback is hard — if you’re a manager you will have to work upstream to overcome some natural power dynamics if you want real honest feedback.  It means being persistent in asking over time, building trust by proving you care, and being willing to take and be grateful for hard feedback when it does come.  Ultimately there is almost nothing you can do that will help you more as a manager than creating an attitude where people are comfortable sharing unfiltered truth with you — you’ll grow faster and be more effective as you learn what is really happening around you, and it is much easier to share hard feedback with people who trust that you’re listening to them.  Feedback is a gift.  Give it, receive it and value it.</p>\n<h3>More Engineering Management Posts</h3>\n<p>This is part of a series of posts on Engineering Management.

You get to wear a lot of hats — technical leader, domain expert, coach, chaos-tamer, and are pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot.  My 2 years in this role has not always been easy, but it has pushed me to grow more than any other stretch in my career. It’s a great role for people who like a challenge and thrive on taking on different types of work depending on the day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grnh.se/5765189b1us\">Frontend Engineers</a> at Kustomer get a large amount of autonomy to solve business and user experience problems in their domain of expertise.  Every team has a dedicated Product Manager and Designer that you’ll be collaborating closely with, and we’re at a fun point in our growth where we’re taking a product that has grown organically and finding ways to standardize best practices, improve performance, and be more consistent in building great user experiences, not just “working” experiences.  It adds up to a lot of great technical challenges, and we’re big enough to have experienced engineers to support and teach while still being small enough to have lots of room for people to come in and own important problems.  Our core stack is React / Redux / TypeScript / Jest / Cypress / Webpack.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grnh.se/3fe8d8871us\">Backend Engineers</a> have similar collaborative and ownership opportunities as FE devs, and get to work in a modern Node microservice based codebase with its own set of interesting technical challenges, especially as we scale the product.  We spend a lot of time thinking about reliable message processing, storing and performantly accessing large amounts of data, and applying machine learning and intelligent automation techniques to customer service data.  Our core stack is Node / Express / Docker / ECS / AWS / MongoDB / ElasticSearch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*All of these roles will eventually be New York City based, but are currently operating remotely.  *</p>\n<p>If any of the above roles sound like the right type of challenge for you please feel free to reach out and apply.  You’re also welcome to <a href=\"mailto:ben@kustomer.com\">contact me</a> with any questions about working at Kustomer.  Helping bring new awesome people who are excited about what we’re doing into the company is the most important thing I can do both for them, for Kustomer and for making my own job great, so always happy to talk.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/09/23/kustomer-is-hiring"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"what-do-ems-do,play-other-positions,change-without-authority","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"ems-choosing-what-to-work-on","title":"Engineering Management: Choosing What To Work On","description":"How do you pick what to do?","layout":"post","path":"/2021/02/21/ems-choosing-what-to-work-on","date":"2021/02/21","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>I’m currently taking some time away from my job on parental leave, and it seemed like a good time to reflect on the lessons I’ve learned the last few years about engineering management, this is my second post here, a followup to my post on <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do\">What EMs do</a></em></p>\n<p>In my last post I listed a <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do\">bunch of different things</a> that engineering managers can do to produce value.  Given the sheer number of things that engineering managers can consider doing to help their teams and make an impact, the next question quickly becomes: how do I balance my time and work on the right things?  I think of this in terms of maintaining rhythms, finding high leverage work, and following some principles for maintaining sanity.</p>\n<p>There are a number of <strong>rhythms</strong> that I try to maintain every week.  For me these include 1-1s with my team, our agile sprint rituals, preparing weekly updates for our VPE and CTO, and dedicated time set aside for strategic work.  I focus on protecting these times and as much as possible, but also maintain a pretty high bar for what type of thing I set up as a recurring meeting or obligation.  I draw a distinction here between things I do a lot, and things I try to do <em>every</em> day/week/sprint/month.  Making it a regular commitment prevents these things from being washed away by busy periods and unlocks the compounding benefits of something that is routinely practicied.</p>\n<p>Rhythms are a great fit for activities that are high value but low urgency, like maintaining important relationships, keeping up good information flow, and protecting time for longer term creative work.  The important thing here is being selective and as I’ll discuss more below, making sure to review regularly to make sure they’re still a good use of time.  Rhythms become an anti-pattern when they get disconnected from value — when you keep doing something that is no longer providing value — a zombie standup meeting or a regular meeting with another team that could just be handled through async communication.  I doubt that there is a universal ideal ratio of rhythms to unstructered time, but for me personally I end up having about 20 hours each week that is preblocked for the same activities every week, and that has felt like an appropriate tradeoff between the urgent and new with the consistent and important.</p>\n<p>With my remaining time I try to focus as much as possible on <strong>high leverage activity</strong>.  As in my last post I’m borrowing language from Andy Grove’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZvSXnP\">High Output Management</a> here — leverage is simply a term for an activity’s value relative to its cost in time/effort.  So training somebody to do repeating work is often higher leverage than doing it yourself; you pay a one time cost to get an ongoing benefit of the task being completed and growing one of your teammate’s careers.  If the term leverage doesn’t speak to you, you can think of the pareto principle and trying to work on the 20% of stuff that brings 80% of the value, or working “smarter not harder”.  The point is to figure out what activities are going to have outsized impact and push to prioritize them.</p>\n<p>Will Larson has a good guide on identifying <a href=\"https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters\">work that matters</a>.  It’s focused on staff-plus engineers, but the principles apply to EMs equally well.  Once you’ve exhausted low effort high value efforts, there’s more value in taking on the bigger problems that will truly impact a company.  Swarm on existential issues, but otherwise try to find places to work where there’s room to make impact but you will get support.  You can scale your impact by investing in people and <em>nudging</em> or editing other folks approaches without having to own everything yourself or by helping them finish projects that need a bit of help getting to done.  And it’s important to see if there are only things that you can do.  I can’t phrase this better than Will did so I would highly recommend reading the whole thing on his site. I would add that for managers ultimately all of our value will disappear if we do not have a high-performing team that is able to stick together and make progress over time.  I’ve never regretted spending time investing useful time into my team.</p>\n<p>Of course in real life, picking high leverage activities is not an exercise where we calmly sit back and pick from a neatly arranged menu of options.  Instead as an EM you will be bombarded with requests for your time; meetings with other teams and departments, project meetings, compliance documentation, onboarding new employees, performance reviews, mandatory company trainings, process improvement discussions, status update requests and more.  Some of these things will be high value and important, depending on the culture of your company almost all of them may appear urgent.  It isn’t a productive goal to only ever work on the most important things at all time.  There will always be urgent work that you’ll find you feel you need to do.  However there are better and worse ways to handle this flood of urgency.</p>\n<p>Effective managers know the importance of saying <em>no</em> to many things in order to focus on the essential.  There’s space to grow beyond that though — a <em>no</em> that preserves a manager’s integrity is better than a <em>yes</em> that they fail to follow through on, or one that leads to them working on the wrong things.  But even better is if they can work with the people making requests on their time to find ways to make the urgent request smaller, or help get it delegated to people who will grow through the work.  Ultimately managers are as effective as their relationships and finding ways to say yes without getting distracted from the most important work is a valuable advanced skill.  Of course the temptation can be to trade away these hard decisions and problems by simply giving more time.</p>\n<p>Working more hours is the ultimate short term time management power move.  It’s also a quick path to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage\">burnout</a>.  I try to follow a few <strong>principles</strong> to keep my schedule sane.</p>\n<p>First it’s important to reconsider your time commitments regularly, especially any recurring meetings/commitments.  Many recurring meetings degrade in usefulness over time, and even ones that should be a bedrock of a manager’s schedule like 1-1s may need to be adjusted as the needs of the participants change.  I try to reconsider my calendar as a whole at least once a quarter, and anytime I have what feels like an unproductive meeting or a scattered day I try to think through whether I can make any adjustments to my schedule to improve in the future.   This can be as simple as Lara Hogan’s concept of <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-energy-drain/#calendar-color-coding-and-defragging\">defragging my calendar</a> to put similar things together and clear creative space, or involve reworking a meeting that has gone stale to be more useful for the team — maybe even reducing its frequency or canceling it and replacing it with an async process.</p>\n<p>My second principle is that constraints are good.  Any EM will have an essentially infinite amount of work.  There’s always more training, strategy, preparation and planning that can be done.  If you’re still comfortable coding that represents another near-infinite pool of potential contribution.  A <em>work till it’s all done</em> approach simply won’t succeed.  There is always more.  So I try to embrace a schedule and accept that schedule as a constraint to solve for in my work.  At points this has been a literal daily stopping time for me — more commonly in my career I’ve simply held a value of being there for my family and protecting family time, as well as protecting my health and time to take care of it.  That has meant that at times I have flexibility to pour a lot of time into work, and other times I’m more limited in my total time to devote to work.  In each case though I’m able to take a finite amount of time and do my best to optimize it for the challenges in front of me.</p>\n<h3>Stay Sane, Keep Your Integrity, and Remember That People Matter The Most</h3>\n<p>Managing your time in more senior roles is hard.  You’re not given the direction that you may have gotten used to as an IC engineer, and a lot of the most important work won’t have a timer or anyone yelling at you to get it done.  If you’re struggling with this I recommend giving yourself grace.  And if you take anything from this piece I hope you remember to protect yourself with constraints so that you stay sane, avoid compromising your integrity by over-committing and ultimately err on the side of investing in people.  In 5 years it will be the people you’re interacting with today who are going to have the biggest impact on your career, and as I look at the scope of the rest of my life I expect it to be my impact on people that I remember for better or worse, much more than the results of a project or whether I nailed a certain process for my team.</p>\n<h3>More Engineering Management Posts</h3>\n<p>This is part of a series of posts on Engineering Management.

Nothing gets lost in translation when the quarterback can give his directives in a way the receiver clearly understands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He can talk our language,” said Ryan Switzer, who played with Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh for two seasons. “He can talk leverage, he can talk technique, he can talk lean and press, he can talk all these things, which makes the communication a lot more fluid between us and him. … He’s able to communicate really well, which helps translate to being on the same page more often on the field.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The carryover from one position to another goes beyond communication. Iriti sees it in the way Roethlisberger eludes the pass rush and finds a receiver on a broken play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s like he knows where he’s at, and he knows where you’re trying to go, so he can wait until that last second, just make that little move,” Iriti said. “It’s not fast, it’s not quick, but it’s like it’s premeditated that he knows where you’re going. So it makes him seem more agile and quick than he actually is. He’s not a blazing-fast guy, but instinctively he’s really smart.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Playing a position that he later had to collaborate with allowed Roethlisberger to communicate with his teammates better and make better adjustments when things went wrong and he needed to understand or anticipate his teammates reactions.</p>\n<p>Reading Roethlisberger’s stories reminded me of some of my own practices as a high school basketball player. Our coaches would force us to switch positions around when practicing plays.  The theory was that you didn’t really know a play until you could execute on every position’s part of it.  As a tall but gawky and uncoordinated high schooler, I was never likely to move away from my forward position to become a full time point guard, but the exercise was useful both for the reasons called out above, as well as the flexibility it gave us to play different lineups for shorter stretches during a game.  If we had problems with injuries or foul trouble, we could get away with playing people at a different position for some stretch of time, or play different groupings of players that let us take advantage of matchups.</p>\n<p>So what does any of this have to do with the purported topic of this blog, productive software teams?  It turns out that modern software teams have a lot in common with sports teams.  They’re a collection of individuals with different skillsets who take on different roles to work together towards a set of goals over time.  Our work has less black and white scorekeeping, and the lines between “games” are a lot blurrier, but there is a lot we can learn from the world of sports.</p>\n<p>The lessons from my high school basketball days have stuck with me as I’ve progressed through my software career.  I find that I collaborate better with my teammates when I have some sense of what it is like to do their job.  A benefit of spending the last 7 years in startups was the opportunity to wear a lot of different hats on a short term basis.  I’ve always done an mix of front end and backend development. I once was assigned the role of being primary test engineer for a major release while our normal QA lead was taking a few weeks off out of the country.  As my career advanced I got to get more involved with the product management side of things, collaborating closely with PMs to help shape how products got built.  I even spent a memorable and painful couple months as my team’s primary designer after a round of layoffs.  As both an individual contributor and an engineering manager, these experiences have helped me work well with a variety of different people, identify times when teammates in different roles were talking past each other, and plug gaps when the need arose. It also gives me empathy for people who are facing the tough parts of their job, and a level of humility when approaching discussions that comes from knowing there are always many perspectives on a particular problem or process.</p>\n<p>Unlike sports, we don’t usually consciously “practice” in software development.  That may be a mistake, but given it is the world we live in, how do we actually develop this type of experience?  I’ve found 3 primary things helpful: doing the work, talking with people experienced in the role, and reading about the role.  This isn’t that different than the learning process if you actually wanted to pursue a particular role, the time commitment is just lower.</p>\n<p>If you have the ability to just do a piece of a project in a different role or fill in for someone for a short time, that can be the easiest way to quickly develop some intuition about a role.  For some role combos that’s pretty easy.  A software engineer can always take a shot at doing more of a test engineer role.  Look at another developer’s code and think about how you would test it. You probably won’t be doing what a full time test engineer would do, but just getting into the mindset can be helpful.  It can feel harder to cover other roles - how would you “try out” being an engineering manager as a junior engineer?  But you might be able to ask the person in that role if there’s some part of their job you can help them with.  Then you get to try out a piece of the role and potentially get some guidance to go with it.</p>\n<p>One problem with “just doing it” is that when we first try a new skill or role, we don’t know what we don’t know.  It’s easy to perform a parody of the role if we don’t get any meaningful feedback on our performance.  So it is helpful to talk with somebody who is experienced in the role, ideally an expert.  They can give you feedback on your attempts or just tell you about what they do and how they see the world.  The ability to listen well and ask good questions can take you far here.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are a lot of written resources out there for learning about different roles.  To help work with people in a certain role it can help to read some of the “classic” essays or books about a role.  A learning-focused person in the role will be able to make recommendations, but if you don’t have a good resource there you can get a similar effect with careful googling for “best books for product managers” or similar.  Some books I’ve found helpful for understanding different roles include <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KVewdZ\">Inspired</a> for product managers, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hx6Iee\">The Manager’s Path</a> for engineering managers, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hyC6ca\">The Design of Everyday Things</a> for product designers.</p>\n<p>For pretty much every piece of career advice out there, there are pathological variations that should be avoided.  Almost everything can be taken too far or stripped of context to the point where it becomes harmful.  I’ve seen at least one common way that the pursuit of understanding our teammates roles can go wrong.  That is simple ego; it can be tempting to believe that because we’ve walked a mile in somebody’s shoes we’re the experts and our voices should now hold heavy weight when making decisions in our teammates area of expertise.  We should always be listening to our teammates and taking in different opinions. However, it is still valuable to have “owners” for a role, and spending a week or a month or even a year working in a role is not the same as making it your career.  There are going to be times where a more experienced team will need to support somebody in their role, especially if they’re new.  But that’s not the same as you “being able to do it better” or “having veto power”.  This can get quite bad; I’ve known engineers who genuinely believed that they could step in and do any role in their company better than the people who had made it their careers.  This is the opposite of the empathy we’re trying to create.</p>\n<p>I’m wary about aggrandizing this advice.  Trying other roles is a simple technique for working better with your teammates and it isn’t going to change the world.  But I’m writing this on the first day of 2021.  2020 was a year that was marked by a lot of suffering and struggle across our world, and also one that seemed to me to lead many people away from empathy and connection and toward conflict.  Consider this as a simple way to build empathy and connection with your teammates this year.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/01/01/play-other-positions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"team-output-productivity,good-meetings-are-designed,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"strategies-for-resilience","title":"Strategies For Building Team Resilience","description":"Leading Teams Built For The Longterm","layout":"post","path":"/2021/11/15/strategies-for-resilience","date":"2021/11/15","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>This article was first published in my newsletter, <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/\">Herding Lions</a></em></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3klmrQ9\">Thinking In Systems</a> Donella Meadows observed that when maintaining a system the properties you can choose to optimize for include productivity, stability, and resiliency. Productivity is about producing outputs – for a software team this might be completed projects, fixed bugs, or releases shipped. Stability is about consistency of output; can you maintain the same level of productivity over time? Resilience is the property of being able to recover from perturbations and unexpected changes. For a software team that might mean being able to handle losing a teammate, adapt to remote work or maintaining productivity during a tumultuous time for an organization.</p>\n<p>Meadow’s interesting observation was that because resilience is less observable than productivity or stability, people tend to systematically underinvest in it. We can see outputs go up, and we can measure how they change over time, but resilience is by definition about response to rare and unexpected events, and therefore is hard to measure in normal circumstances. But the last year has been a reminder for many just how important resilience is; whether dealing with moving teams to remote work, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/great-resignation-accelerating/620382/?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">the great resignation</a>, supporting parents whose kids were suddenly home with them during the day, or the trauma of illness or loss from the pandemic, we’ve all had to deal with out of the ordinary circumstances when leading teams this year.</p>\n<p>So how do we cultivate resilience on our teams? Here are a few things I’m thinking about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reduce Work In Progress</strong> - In addition to other benefits, reducing the # of things you’re working on a time helps team be more resilient by encouraging collaboration / shared knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Leave Margin</strong> - Don’t fill 100% of your sprint/quarter/annual planning with roadmap projects. Leave meaningful slack that can be used on technical improvements, unplanned requests, maintenance and learning tasks. That work is valuable to start with but the margin that planning for it provides also can make your team more resilient to changes in plan or scope creep surprises.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Psychological Safety</strong> - Teams that trust each other and can talk about difficult things are less likely to have issues fester and explode, and are more able to weather storms. Building a safe environment is the right thing to do for your teammates regardless of effectiveness, but the business case here is also easy to make.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize Developer Tooling &#x26; Velocity</strong> - Its easy to adjust to change when you can move fast. Velocity makes everything easier, and great tooling also makes it easier to onboard new team members and reduces reliance on the head-canon context of your more experienced team members.</li>\n<li><strong>Hire and Train For Redundancy In Your Team</strong> - Teams of specialists lack resiliency. If only one person can do a particular task, then you’re vulnerable to anything that removes that person: leaving for a new job, an illness, a vacation, or just an opportunity for them to be promoted into new responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Have Everybody Take Real Vacations</strong> - Vacations are good for your team, but when people truly take the time off they’re also great “chaos engineering” experiments for your team to see how well you can function without different team members. If your output is limited when somebody is on vacation, it’s a smell that you can try and correct with some of the other tactics here.</li>\n<li><strong>Rotate Responsibilities</strong> - Similar to the last 2 items, we can build redundancy by making sure that we don’t rely on a single person to always fulfill certain tasks. It’s great to have experts and “owners” but those titles shouldn’t be exclusive and part of the responsibility should be helping others do the work and grow into co-owners.</li>\n<li><strong>Give Everyone Context</strong> - When everybody understands the why behind a team’s work, it’s easier to adapt to changing conditions because that can happen throughout the team – the leader doesn’t need to understand every change or detail</li>\n<li><strong>Write Documentation</strong> - Another way to make it easier to ramp people up or move people between roles is to write things down. This means processes, architecture, how-tos. Thoughtful, well-maintained docs can add significant resilience to a team. Unfortunately this item is also the one that I’ve never really seen done well at a team level and may in practice be unrealistic. At an org level though this is extremely important for resilience.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/11/15/strategies-for-resilience"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"how-teams-go-faster,play-other-positions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"team-output-productivity","title":"Team Output Is The Smallest Unit Of Productivity","description":"A mental model for productivity","layout":"post","path":"/2021/10/27/team-output-productivity","date":"2021/10/27","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>This article was first published in my newsletter, <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/\">Herding Lions</a></em></p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking recently about how most of my growth as a manager has come either from</p>\n<p>a.

We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. Whether we realize it or not, we then use these models every day to think, decide and understand our world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words – the ways we simplify and talk about the world will guide our decisions on how to act. We all simplify, so it’s important to simplify in ways that are accurate and lead to effective actions.\nHow we think about measuring, improving and planning productivity matters a lot! We all want to have impact at work, move the needle and work on things that matter. But most people come into management with a faulty intuition about what productivity looks like.</p>\n<p>Managers often come into their first EM job fresh from the ranks of being an everyday coding engineer. For individual contributor engineers, productivity is commonly judged by personal output. An engineer will be able to say things like “I built that”, I “reviewed that code”, “I tested the project then found and fixed some bugs”. Impact is tangible, demo-able, and obviously tied to some larger objective handed down from above. Even more senior engineers who do more glue work and cross-org communication can usually still point to something that they owned and saw a result from: “I mentored that engineer as he built that”, “I led that project”, “I supported our sales team on that deal”. The life of an IC dev naturally leads to a world where productivity is defined with “I…” statements.</p>\n<p>As a manager you are responsible for optimizing the output of your team over time. This may mean identifying opportunities and bottlenecks in your team’s processes and taking action. It may mean coaching a teammate through leading their first project. It may mean taking on interrupt driven grunt work personally to help your team achieve flow. It may mean standing up to other organizational leaders and making the case for a slower shipping schedule to allow your team to recover from a history of tech debt and burnout. It will certainly not stay the same over time.</p>\n<p>The tempting thing is that it’s still easy to make “I…” statements as an EM. “I held a 1 on 1”, “I wrote the document”, or even “I wrote the code myself”. And because you probably have years of experience of benchmarking your success on those statements, it is deceptively hard to let go of them as a marker of your own personal productivity and progress. Put another way, your mental model of productivity is tied to the quantity and quality of your “I…” statements, and that is holding you back from having a broader impact.</p>\n<p>“I…” sickness in a manager has a lot of common symptoms. I-sick managers don’t delegate as much, or only delegate the tasks they’re not qualified to do and are least able to coach and monitor on. They may confuse trackable busyness with productivity, or burn themselves out trying to keep an IC workload on top of their managerial responsibilities. I could go on for a while; it’s easy for me as this was my personal largest failing as a new manager.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence. - Andy Grove</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An important property of teams is that they abstract the complexities of the individuals that compose them. - Will Larson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me things only started getting better when I fully internalized an idea that I’d heard but not believed at a root level early on in management - the team’s output is the only thing that matters and what I should be optimizing for. I’ve found it most helpful to treat this as a general rule that “team output is the smallest unit of productivity”. That means tracking output at the team level, determining the effectiveness of my own actions based on how it impacts team output, and of course prioritizing work that maximizes “We…” statements, not “I…” statements.</p>\n<p>I’m still not 100% consistent in personally applying this, which helpfully has allowed me to observe the impact of my choices over time. I find that when I focus more on optimizing for the team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is easier to manage my time, and limit my hours to a reasonable level, as my work is more aligned with my built in responsibilities, and I don’t feel the need to hit a quota of personal productivity before clocking out</li>\n<li>it is harder to see the short term impact of my actions, which can be discouraging on days when other external factors are not aligned to help me feel my work is valued or useful</li>\n<li>I create a better environment for my team (duh?) and enjoy my relationships with them more</li>\n<li>Its harder to ignore lingering problems – including messy people problems where the next step may be an uncomfortable discussion</li>\n<li>I end up with a lot more variety in my work, as todays bottlenecks to team output are not likely to be the same as yesterdays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been a very manager-centric view so far, but tracking output at the team level can also have a very powerful impact on your IC teammates. The cult of “I…” based productivity has negative outcomes for non-managers as well. When your teammates are judging their productivity based on the number of tickets they’ve closed, projects that they took the lead on , or tech specs they’ve closed, it makes it harder to encourage glue work, swarming on critical issues, pairing, or other soft skill / collaborative activities.\nIt’s easy to send messages as a manager that reinforce an “I…”-centric view of productivity: early on in my career as a manager I would track individual dev velocity sprint over sprint and divide up Kanban swimlanes by developer. Strangely my teammates always seemed to work in isolation and never had time for work that wasn’t directly assigned to them. When I switched from talking to people about improving their velocity to talking about helping the team achieve great outcomes, I saw huge improvements here. I’m grateful to some more experienced engineers who called me out on this and helped me see the benefits of focusing on the team over the individual at every level.</p>\n<p>If you’re struggling to feel your work as a manager is valuable, feel like you never have enough time to “be productive”, or want to foster more collaboration in your team, start asking yourself: “What can I do today to make my team more effective?” and drop every other metric of productivity until you find that view natural.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/10/27/team-output-productivity"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"how-teams-go-faster,play-other-positions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"thinking-fast-slow","title":"Thinking Fast & Slow: Lessons For Managers","description":"Things To Remember When Working With Humans","layout":"review","path":"/2021/10/21/thinking-fast-and-slow-for-managers","date":"2021/10/21","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I recently read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jpFxUJ\">Thinking Fast &#x26; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman, and it was my favorite read of this year.  I had been generally familiar with Behavioral Economics previously, but this was the deepest I’d gotten into it.  Kahneman is a very strong writer, and it left me with lots of things to think about.  A few of the ideas in particular felt relevant to management, and I thought I’d highlight them here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everybody thinks about their lives and careers as a story.  When we evaluate how good a story it is we tend to think about the high points, low points and most recent feelings <em>only</em>, neglecting how long any of those things lasted. [Summarized from the chapter 36 “Life as a Story”]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This made me think of how a bad week, or a very bad incident in the past can negatively color the story of an employee with an otherwise happy tenure leading to what Michael Lopp calls <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/\">shields down</a> moments.  This can feel unfair for managers who are doing things right and want to maintain their teams, but the main lesson I take is to not let little annoyances fester without addressing them, as little things can shift people’s attitudes by more than is justified by a big picture view.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Humans have a number of cognitive traits that make us bad at predicting and estimating — we ignore evidence that is not currently on our mind, become confident on relatively small pieces of information, and have a tendency to simplify complexity away by answering easier questions than what we’ve been asked. We also over-weight “causal thinking” and underestimate regression to the mean. [Summarized from Chapters 18-24]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was easy enough to accept personally — I’m perennially overconfident in my estimates.  The lesson here in my mind is that more process around predictions may lead to better outcomes; left to our own devices we’ll think less about predictions and not notice that our confidence is based on flimsy evidence.  For more important predictions, processes that force us to be more thorough should help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Humans are very sensitive to how questions are framed — we hate losing things more than we like gaining them, are very associative in our thinking, and often aren’t consistent in how we make choices depending on external factors like a suggested answer, another question we were just asked, or how close it is to a meal.  [Summarized from Chapters 25-34]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see this type of stuff in behavioral economics mostly quoted in terms of “nudge” like behavioral manipulation, but this mostly has me thinking about the importance of communication plans.  It’s easy to think that getting info passed to a team or individual is more important than how you do it, but actually how choices and changes are communicated has a real impact on how people feel about them, which can make a big difference to team morale and retention over the course of many communication opportunities. Lara Hogan has some good resources on communication plans including <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/communicating-news-to-team/\">this article</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We all overweight things that are easy for us to see vs things that are not (availability bias).  We tend to see our own contributions as bigger and more meaningful than others, our own challenges as more painful, and our own skills as more impressive.  Because of course we see all the evidence for those and only a fraction of what others are doing. [Summarized from Chapter 12 and some references elsewhere]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a good reminder to me to be humble and not overweight my own accomplishments first.  But it also is a good thing to keep in mind the next time a teammate feels underappreciated or that they may have been unfairly passed up for an opportunity.  We’re all prisoners of our own perspectives, and while that may sometimes lead us astray in terms of how we stack up a little grace can go a long way here.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/10/21/thinking-fast-and-slow-for-managers"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"team-output-productivity,good-meetings-are-designed,strategies-for-resilience","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"values-scale-culture","title":"Values Are How You Scale Culture","description":"Why have values anyway?","layout":"post","path":"/2021/11/30/values-scale-culture","date":"2021/11/30","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>This article was first published in my newsletter, <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/\">Herding Lions</a></em></p>\n<p>I recently had the pleasure of working with a team to help define <a href=\"https://medium.com/kustomerengineering/kustomers-engineering-values-80d06dae4306?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Kustomer’s engineering values</a>.

Good values help employees make hard choices, help new employees know how to be productive in an organization, and allow hiring for culture fit in a way that doesn’t just translate to “this person looks like me”.</p>\n<p>This of course doesn’t happen in every (most?) organizations that define a set of values. For values to be useful you need meaningful values that are regularly used well. Otherwise they’re just an easy to make fun of list of words.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/5ee295b88c7a03ce6e9ed944bc957f5a/dilbert2.gif\" alt=\"Dilbert Comic\"></p>\n<p>Meaningful values are opinionated tradeoffs and applicable to day to day decisions. Opinionated means that you’re making a choice – values are a decision to prioritize one good over another good, not just to reject something obviously bad. The <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">agile manifesto</a> is a good example of this: instead of saying “Quality is good” (duh!) they say prefer working software over comprehensive documentation – a guiding preference that some devs may not embrace and can practically be used to guide decisions. From Kustomer’s values, we choose to “Optimize For Impact”, which means we may move off of something before getting to perfect, and may explicitly ignore some issues if they won’t move the needle. We value “Do What You Say” because we’re targeting a culture of accountability and trust over one that is simply “nice”. These values directly guide how I as a manager might choose to give feedback in a situation, and how an engineer thinks about calculating scope and an estimated due date for a project.\nMeaningful values are also specific to their context. Instead of writing our own values, Kustomer could have just taken <a href=\"https://about.google/philosophy/?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">Google’s values</a>. And we certainly did look at other companies for inspiration. But ultimately values are useful for defining the culture of a company and the behaviors that are successful there, and that will not be the same between 2 companies. If you ask your employees to start behaving like Google employees that will likely lead to some interesting results, but your context isn’t Google’s and ultimately you’ll likely find that what works for a huge multi-national tech giant may not make sense for you. And realistically the values and behaviors that benefited Google as they were a small growing startup may not be the right ones for them today – <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">they’ve even famously shaded away from “Don’t be evil”</a>. Instead, understand what behaviors and priorities are useful and valued in your current context (some level of aspirational values are appropriate but mostly this should be descriptive of what is effective in your context today), and find ways to communicate those clearly and crisply, preferably using language that you already hear in your company today. It doesn’t mean that you can’t share values with another place or even use a term that is somewhat generic – it just has to have a clear meaning in your culture. Kustomer’s value of “Trust” is somewhat generic as a buzzword, but in practice its a term that has been important throughout our history and internally provides a clear set of priorities – work that threatens our customers’ trust always comes first, and we should always be proactive rather than reactive about quality issues. We also value going fast, but quality comes ahead of velocity. Every new engineer goes through a training where we unpack these concepts, so the value was simply naming something that already existed for us.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve established a set of meaningful values, you still need to regularly put them to use in order to see value. That means referencing them when you make decisions (“We shouldn’t work on this because we need to <strong>optimize for impact</strong>” or “We can’t ship this without a monitoring strategy – we need to keep our customer’s <strong>trust</strong>, and we can’t do that if we don’t know when things break”). It also means rewarding behaviors that align with our values. At the company level, Kustomer monthly recognizes an employee who embodies our “Don’t just talk about it, be about it” value with a DJTAIBAI award. I’ve seen other companies experiment with “micro-awards” where employees have a budget for sending other employees rewards that get tied to their values. This also can work into your normal processes of evaluation and recognition by emphasizing behavior that aligns or deviates from values in performance reviews and 1-1 coaching. The more the values get talked about and rewarded as expected behavior, the more they have the power to scale culture.</p>\n<p>Values are a tool for naming the culture you want to have and starting to iterate to it. They don’t guarantee that you’ll get there, and if the values you list aren’t already a meaningful reality for at least part of your company, they’re probably not going to transform your team. But they can help you scale what you have as you grow, and they can help set a bar that will open the path to the difficult conversations needed when things need to change.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021/11/30/values-scale-culture"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"how-teams-go-faster,play-other-positions,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"what-do-ems-do","title":"Engineering Management: What do EMs do anyway?","description":"The activities of an Engineering Manager","layout":"post","path":"/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do","date":"2021/02/18","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>I’m currently taking some time away from my job on parental leave, and it seemed like a good time to reflect on the lessons I’ve learned the last few years about engineering management, starting with a base assumption of what it is that engineering managers actually do</em></p>\n<p>There are a lot of different ideas out there about what engineering managers actually do, from pithy one liners like “nothing” or “meetings” to detailed expectations that sound like a superset of tech lead, project manager, and people manager roles.  When I got started in management I quickly found that at fast growing companies people will happily flow as much work as possible to EMs, and it’s important to have a clear idea of what your job really is, because the workload will quickly become larger than one person can do — at which point effective managers excel primarily because of good time management and prioritization.  Those skills start by understanding your core responsibilities.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZvSXnP\">High Output Management</a> Andy Grove summarizes a manager’s output as the sum of the output of his team and the output of neighboring teams that he influences.  A manager’s goal then is to maximize those outputs — a framing that is helpful to come back to when it comes to prioritizing work.  Making good choices of what to work on is a <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/21/ems-choosing-what-to-work-on\">different article</a>, but for now I’d like to consider a semi-comprehensive list of the different areas a manager can focus to influence those outputs. In my career and reading I’ve seen a pretty consistent set of 3 high level areas that effective managers invest in: facilitating information flow, driving progress forward, and building a sustainably productive team.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilitating information flow</strong> includes a mix of information gathering and information sharing.  Engineering Managers are responsible for doing the work to understand what is happening in their team and also understand what is happening in the broader organization.  Effective EMs then find useful ways to synthesize and share that information to help their teams be more effective and give other teams and executives clarity into what is happening with their team.  There are a multitude of anti-patterns here including undersharing or oversharing in either direction, manipulating people via information flow, and failing to extract and emphasize the most critical pieces of information.  But doing this right means bringing clarity to everyone an EM works with, pushing the most important information to the people who need it and making it easy for people to pull other information when needed.</p>\n<p>Tools for facilitating information flow include 1 on 1 meetings, building or advocating for processes and tools that expose team and project status clearly, encapsulating decisions and reasoning in documents that can be shared widely and referenced later, and asking good questions in standups and project meetings that lead to better understanding of problems and any misalignments between the team and the business.  Getting good at this stuff means being a good written and verbal communicator, keeping an attitude of curiousity and humility that lets you learn from others and stay up to date with what is going on, and being intentional about building relationships with all of the key people you work with.</p>\n<p><strong>Driving progress forward</strong> breaks down into 3 parts: decision influencing, delegating/monitoring and “doing the work”.  The first item here is phrased as <em>decision influencing</em> rather than decision making because while you will have to make many decisions as an Engineering Manager it is even more common and in many cases more desirable that you’ll be providing input and influence on decisions but not ultimately “owning” the decision yourself.  <a href=\"/2021/02/26/ems-how-to-delegate\">Delegating work to others</a> is an important part of getting things done and scaling yourself as a manager, but to again quote Andy Grove “delegation without follow-through is abdication”.  So even delegated tasks still require the work of monitoring and supporting, and thus take time.  Finally, EMs sometimes take on work that is actually directly part of their teams day to day — writing code for a feature, designing architecture for an upcoming project, or debugging a production issue.  That last point is the most controversial — there are plenty of “engineering managers shouldn’t code” zealots out there.  I simply add it here as something an EM <em>can</em> do to increase their team’s output.  Whether it is an effective or impactful activity is going to be highly context specific and is out of the scope of this article.</p>\n<p>Progress on a team’s work has the shortest feedback loop of the 3 top level areas: missing information can often go unnoticed for a while, and unhappy teams’ troubles may take a while to manifest.  But everybody notices when your team is not succeeding at it’s goals.  Thus the anti-patterns here are often trading off team and communication for an appearance of progress: doing too much work yourself at the expense of your team’s development and long term scalability, failing to take responsibility for your team’s output — often by delegating without supporting a teammate, or making decisions that optimize for making yourself look good at the expense of your team or other parts of your organization.  Getting really good at driving progress as an engineering manager means learning to delegate with an appropriate amount of support and monitoring, learning how to influence work usefully without having to own it end to end and being strategic about what you yourself try to own.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a sustainably productive team</strong> involves a mix of hiring, culture shaping, team development, and what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rands\">Michael Lopp</a> calls the <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/#:~:text=care%20and%20feeding%20of%20engineers\">care and feeding of engineers</a>.  Hiring new engineers is arguably the highest leverage activity we undertake as engineering managers — it’s a one time process that will have impacts on your team for years.  Engineering managers have outsized influence on their team’s culture: what work is valued, what the expectations are for meeting preparation and timeliness, how people are treated, what type of people and ideas are welcome.  This is often influenced as much by what EMs neglect as what they do.  EMs can help their teammates develop through <a href=\"/2021/03/07/ems-how-to-give-feedback\">thoughtful feedback</a>, coaching, sponsorship and training.  And we work in an industry where our teammates usually have many great work options — setting aside the moral case for being a compassionate manager, managers that do not care for their employees, understand their needs, concerns and ambitions, and help them thrive are unlikely to develop a sustainably productive team over any length of time.</p>\n<p>The biggest anti-pattern here is simply neglecting the work — I’ve worked for and around managers who simply didn’t take the time to regularly talk with their team, were not mindful of the impact their actions had on culture, or treated their employees as replacable cogs in an industrial machine.  Even hiring is often not given the investment it deserves based on impact: many managers are content to offload sourcing and evaluation to other people or put minimal time into preparing for interviews and new job postings.  Getting really good at building a sustainable team means thinking of yourself as a role model for the behavior you want to see, investing heavily in hiring and supporting your current team, regularly giving and seeking meaningful feedback and being organized about helping your team in their career growth.</p>\n<h3>It’s all about outcomes</h3>\n<p>I labeled this list as semi-comprehensive because while most of the valuable work I do as an engineering manager falls under one of the categories above, managing engineers is fundamentally different than the type of work someone who has just been promoted from a mid-senior engineering role might be used to.  Instead of taking tasks or projects to completion, you’re now operating at a level of an organization where the expected deliverables get a little hazier and you’re being asked to achieve higher level business outcomes.</p>\n<p>So don’t be afraid to shift the time you spend on different parts of this list over time or even do work that seems a bit far afield from your role.  If it’s grounded in a desire to produce good outcomes for the business and help your team and it won’t get done without you stepping in, consider it part of the job.</p>\n<h3>More Engineering Management Posts</h3>\n<p>This is part of a series of posts on Engineering Management.

Continuing that thought, in the spirit of new habits in the new year this week will explore the question of how to choose what to focus on with the time that you do have. After all, efficiency is only valuable if it is pointed in a worthwhile direction.</p>\n<p>Generally the time on my schedule can be divided into 3 categories - ongoing rhythms, one off must-dos, and opportunities. Each of these requires a different strategy.</p>\n<h3>Rhythms</h3>\n<p>Rhythms are my word for any activity or task that takes place on a regular cadence (daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly). As EMs we’re likely to have rhythm meetings focused around our teams (standups, 1-1s, quarterly planning, performance reviews), as well as upward and outward rhythms (staff meetings or regular cross-departmental syncs), and personal rhythms (clearing time each week to write a status report, or do code reviews or review the backlog).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you get one percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. - <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement?utm_campaign=Herding%20Lions&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">James Clear</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Healthy rhythms are extremely valuable. When you thoughtfully invest in relationships or valuable work on a regular basis, that investment can compound and redefine the type of impact you and your team can achieve. And regular maintenance of important relationships or projects can also help you stay informed and aware when things are off. When I plan out my quarters and years, I spend much more time on figuring out what rhythms and habits I want to maintain or develop than setting goals, because it’s the regular investment of time that ultimately leads us wherever we end up.</p>\n<p>However, not all rhythms are healthy and inefficient rhythms that are not thoughtfully moving you toward some broader goal can be a painful tax on your productivity and your sense of well-being. Almost everyone who has done time in the corporate world has had the experience at some point of regularly attending a meeting that seemed to provide little value to many or all of the participants, where engagement was low and morale was lower. This type of “rhythm” can easily have negative externalities where it wastes not just the hour in the meeting but time before where you’re dreading it and time after when you’re recovering as well.\nBetter time management with regard to rhythms means designing your rhythms. That means understanding the <strong>why</strong> behind each recurring calendar event and taking steps to remove or redeem the low and negative value ones. <a href=\"/2021/11/03/good-meetings-are-designed\">I covered this for meetings a few weeks ago</a>, but the principles apply to any regular use of time. It also means taking the time to evaluate your goals and focus areas and consider whether there are any rhythms you <strong>should</strong> be investing in that might allow you to unlock the type of compound gains that require regular time. This could be clearing time for networking, building a new skill, 1-1s with key peers, or just dedicated “focus time” that you block and protect for deep work.</p>\n<h3>Must-Dos</h3>\n<p>Ok so this is the tricky one — what if you’re drowning in “must do” work? There may be seasons where you really are filling your calendar with mostly one-off non-recurring work. If this is a short term season with a clear ending (a big project push, a switch to a new team or company) that may be fine, but this is an area to tread carefully. When we perceive a large chunk of work as things we <strong>must</strong> do, it becomes much harder to be thoughtful about balancing our priorities.</p>\n<p>It’s a cliché, but the key for this type of work is developing a healthy ability to say no, as well as good rhythms of prioritizing and evaluating your time. EMs who say yes to everything will quickly overwhelm themselves, and even worse will overwhelm and burn out their teams; so the ability to say <strong>no</strong> in a way that is effective and doesn’t burn bridges within your organization is a key skill. But often time work that we’re pushed to do <strong>is</strong> valuable. So the key is to make sure you’re prioritizing thoughtfully, and that takes time. I have a few questions that I commonly ask when considering external requests (or marching orders passed from above)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is this a high leverage activity?</strong> I love Andy Grove’s model of manager time being valued in terms of leverage, or how much impact an action has relative to time/effort commitment. For asks of both me personally and my team, it’s helpful to see whether this is an incremental win or something that will enable more value over time. You can also think about this in terms of return on investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can somebody else do this?</strong> For EMs, almost any work that can be done by somebody else on their team should be done by somebody else. Especially if you feel like you’re spending a high amount of time on urgent “must do” work. Give away your Legos, develop your time and clear your time to work on higher level work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Can I do less here?</strong> When people are making external requests of you, most of the time they’ll ask for everything they think they might want up front, and are not thinking about your schedule. If the work isn’t core to your responsibilities, it’s always worth asking if there is a scrappier solution that will still make people happy. There’s a fine line to walk here — you don’t want to become known for skimpy/sloppy work, but it’s important to develop a habit of understanding what level of quality is needed for a task. People are used to making cost vs speed vs quality choices, and can usually help you understand their priorities if you frame things in that light (I can do it like this now, or do the full thing next month. If you need the full thing now it will mean stopping all work on some other thing they care about)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Opportunities</h3>\n<p>The final category of work is the most likely to get pushed off your category. This is work that won’t blow up if its neglected, might not ever be asked about, and in many cases isn’t visible to the rest of your org at first. This is taking the time to do a deep dive on understanding the quality issues on your “problem feature”, writing a reusable onboarding plan for your team to make it easier to add new teammates or clearing time to organize a brainstorming session on future roadmap activities. If you don’t already have ideas of what this might be for you, you could always start with clearing time to think about what areas your team could most improve in and your top ideas for addressing those problems.</p>\n<p>This type of strategic deep work is an important part of having a team that is continuously improving. Without time to identify and understand problems, and time to address those issues, most teams will stagnate. And while that leadership can come from anywhere, on many issues it is often most impactful and most practical for it to start with an EM. The key skill for opportunities is to keep an identified list of your top strategic opportunities and priorities so that as time does become available to work on them, you’re ready to take advantage and don’t automatically fill that time with lower priority work.</p>\n<p>Every EMs calendar is going to shift over time, with some months bringing more opportunities and others resembling more of a fire fighting session. But consistent habits of designing your rhythms, carefully evaluating the asks that come in to you and your team, and identifying and prioritizing key opportunities can go a long way. An Engineering Manager’s calendar abhors a vacuum and time will fill up. Invest in making sure that it goes to the right things.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2022/01/11/more-thoughts-on-time"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"team-output-productivity,good-meetings-are-designed,simple-burnout-triage","topics":["leadership","productivity"],"category":"eng-management","key":"mental-models-for-change","title":"Mental Models For Managing Change","description":"How to think about roadmap changes","layout":"post","path":"/2022/01/25/mental-models-for-change","date":"2022/01/25","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>This article was first published in my newsletter, <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/\">Herding Lions</a></em></p>\n<p>At this point I’ve spent the large majority of my career working in startups at different stages. While life can look very different in a 15 person early stage startup and a 300 employee growth stage startup, one thing that is constant across every startup I’ve encountered is a rapid pace of change and a relatively short time horizon for planning. Plans aren’t made for too long in advance, and yet often still manage to change significantly before reaching the original goal. Even in more stable environments, the reality is every software project is a unique undertaking to bring something new into the world. That brings an unavoidable level of unpredictability, meaning that everyone working in software must accept dealing with changing plans and priorities.</p>\n<p>Some common questions predictably come with this state of affairs. How much change is too much? For a specific change, why are we doing this instead of sticking to our original plan? As engineering leaders we need to be able to both make choices about what changes to advocate for and push back on, and also learn how to explain those choices to our teams and other folks we work with.</p>\n<p>I’ve found 2 different models helpful for thinking about changes in plans.</p>\n<h3>Understanding the level of the change</h3>\n<p>Changes in roadmap can come in at a few different levels. Understanding the level can help you understand how to think about it, and how to talk to your team about it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A consequence of existing ambiguity</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This occurs when a team didn’t have clear committed plans previously or didn’t communicate them clearly elsewhere. This is less of a change and more a symptom of ongoing chaos. If a situation like this persists, it is the Engineering Manager’s problem to fix.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>A higher level need</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A team is sometimes asked to do something that doesn’t directly tie into its mission, but is important for the broader company. Examples include helping another team with their project, or working on a revenue driving sales ask that wasn’t part of the original product roadmap.</p>\n<p>Higher level requests are important to take seriously and often are the right thing to do. But if they become a regular pattern it can be a sign that your team doesn’t have the right mission, or you’re getting sucked into thinking too short term.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>A tactical change</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When working on a project a team often learns about new and better ways to achieve their goals. A different approach to code, a new feature that moves the same goal, or putting different people with a new perspective on a problem are all new pieces of.information that serve as opportunities to make a better plan.</p>\n<p>Tactical changes are normal and a sign that you’re paying attention to what you learn as you go. However, If you’re making these type of changes repeatedly, they’re not tied to a clear lesson from the work you’re doing, or you’re making similar tweaks on every project (looks like we need to add unexpected time for more testing again) it might be a sign that you didn’t properly plan or the team isn’t aligned on a goal.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>A strategic change</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sometimes teams change plans because their overall approach to achieving their goals has changed. Maybe they’ve decided to focus on a specific segment of their customer base or realized they need to focus on building up our quality before releasing new features.</p>\n<p>The most important thing with strategic changes is clear communication – do your team and the stakeholders around your team understand not just what new work you’re doing, but also the strategic change behind it? If not, that misalignment can quickly move a project into muddy waters.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>A change in mission</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sometimes a team’s whole purpose can change. This often corresponds with a reorg or a higher level strategic change in the company. These changes should be rare, but are a good opportunity for a team to increase its impact.</p>\n<p>After a change in mission expect to spend a lot of time learning, helping teammates work through the change, and handling a period of other change requests – because by default you’ve found your way back to ambiguity and it is your job to work your way out of that.</p>\n<h3>Track Your Stability Over Time</h3>\n<p>Beyond examining individual changes it can be helpful to keep track of how often you’re changing your plans over time. Some teams are naturally more stable, while others change plans more often. These aren’t necessarily descriptions of virtue – a team that never changes its plan can end up being slow to respond to environment changes and continue for months on low impact work, but a team that is constantly changing plans may never hold a direction long enough to make a dent in any problem. It’s best to consider this along 2 axes, level of change and level of impact.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 570px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/0a47e/changechart.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.545454545454554%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Chart showing the change model\"\n        title=\"Chart showing the change model\"\n        src=\"/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/432e7/changechart.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/a6b04/changechart.png 143w,\n/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/0e2fe/changechart.png 285w,\n/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/432e7/changechart.png 570w,\n/static/ee508dbf9d1533574f641a5e3fe1e32e/0a47e/changechart.png 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Teams that are stagnant may need to consider more aggressively seeking feedback on their approach from users and consider making changes, or finding a higher value mission that is unlocking more impact over time.</p>\n<p>Teams that are churning on the other hand might need to commit to finishing more, even if that means being a bit less responsive to new requests or opportunities. A discipline of making and then completing small time bound goals can be helpful here.</p>\n<p>Of course there’s a fine line between stagnant and steady, churning and adaptive. An approach that was working before might go stale, and a team that appears stagnant may be in the early stages of unlocking a big iterative return. So this model should be used carefully, but it is helpful to have an opinion on where your team stands today as you consider new requests to change your plans.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2022/01/25/mental-models-for-change"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"philosophy-of-software-design-book,clean-architecture-book,tech-leads-book","topics":["leadership","book-review"],"category":"reviews","key":"radical-candor-book","title":"Book Review: Radical Candor","description":"The best book I read in 2018","layout":"review","path":"/2019/01/01/book-review-radical-candor","date":"2019/01/01","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Have you ever read a non-fiction book that you just couldn’t put down because you kept hitting paragraph after paragraph of useful, practical wisdom?

People who don’t care about those they work with and also don’t challenge them fall into manipulative insincerity and should be avoided at all costs.  The Steve Jobsian category of Obnoxious Aggression is when somebody is willing to challenge directly but doesn’t care about the people they’re challengin. To Scott’s mind, Obnoxious Aggression is preferred over Ruinous Empathy; when people who hate the idea of hurting somebody so much that they fail to tell them important truths.  But the target quadrant is Radical Candor, a state where you deal with people in a way that is backed by real humanity while still being willing to be exceptionally honest and challenging.</p>\n<p>This core idea wasn’t super new to me, I had seen it formulated in Church contexts as <code class=\"language-text\">Grace + Truth = Growth</code> in the past.  But Scott puts in the work to show how these ideas play out in a wide variety of professional situations and relationships, and her examples left me teeming with new ideas on how to interact better with my coworkers.  The theme is good, but the implementation ideas and little nuggets of wisdom and experience sprinkled throughout are better.

When I first went through this sheet, I circled over 40 words as values that “resonated” with me.  They’re things that I value and strive for, or wish that I was more like.  Deciding between adventurousness and cowardice is not a “values decision”. A real values decision means that you’re trying to decide whether good traits like adventurousness, belonging, or clear-mindedness are more important to you.</p>\n<p>Management often forces you to choose between goods: Will we ship quicker? Aim for higher quality? How do those choices impact work/life balance for our teams?. It’s hard to know if we’re making good choices, because the results routinely lack clarity.  Indicators lag, causation is fuzzy, and we don’t get to compare to a control group.  Values can be guideposts through ambiguity.  I’ve seen the power of this at a company level in my current gig, where having a set of values that are kept in the spotlight often allows us to weaponize them as decision making tools <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Going through the list, I eventually cut things down to 20, 12, 10 and then 8.

I’ve already seen these values bring a clarity to my thinking about tough things in a short period of time.

I care about doing work that is good and meets the needed standards, but tend to move to the next challenge when I pass that bar and hit diminishing returns”.<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/06/03/thinking-values"}}}],"topic":"leadership"}},
