I’m glad that I did.  The book is a great experience for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the JavaScript language in a practical grounded fashion.</p>\n<h3>Whats the book like?</h3>\n<p>The subtitle of the book, “68 Specific Ways To Harness The Power Of JavaScript”, gives you a hint as to what it will be like.  The book contains 68 best-practice”items”, each an imperative sentence (Prefer Primitives to Object Wrappers, Get comfortable using Higher-Order Functions), divided into 7 chapters (Accustoming yourself to JavaScript, Variable Scope, Objects and Prototypes,  Arrays and Dictionaries, Library and API design, Concurrency).  Each of these items contains an in depth examination of why it is a best practice.  You could read through the table of contents and get something out of the book, but the heart of this book is the way that the author fully digs into each best practice, explaining not only why its a good idea but also what the exception cases are, and why it might be a good idea to break the rule.  The way the discussion of language attributes is grounded by the practical imperative statements, combined with the clear and concise explanations of the author makes everything feel extremely relevant.</p>\n<h3>Who is the book for?</h3>\n<p>This is a great book for people who are familiar with JavaScript, and maybe know some of the best practices, but want to deepen their understanding of how the language works and how to use it better.  This is not a comprehensive reference book, or an introductory text for people just starting with Javascript.  I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026691/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026691&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1118026691\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596517742\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> respectively for those cases.  This book will increase understanding, not knowledge of the syntax or basics.</p>\n<h3>What is good about the book?</h3>\n<p>The layered explanations are fantastic.  On the top layer the author gives you the <strong>specific</strong> best practices, then follows that with an explanation of the underlying reasons for these practices, gives examples of them in action, and following up with any cases where it might be best to use a different method.  The book communicates clearly and concisely about complex subjects.  The payoff is understanding.</p>\n<h3>What is not so great?</h3>\n<p>I felt the chapter on Library and API design was significantly weaker than the rest of the book.  Perhaps it’s because I’m not currently working on building a library, but these chapters felt less like deep explanations and more like quick writeups to justify the stating of the best practices.  The depth of the other explanations was not there.</p>\n<h3>Want to buy it?</h3>\n<p>Its available on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321812182/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321812182&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=HOPC6ZNKSVMH3NZ7\">Amazon</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321812182\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\n.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/06/book-review-effective-javascript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Book Review","Jasmine","Testing"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Javascript Testing with Jasmine","description":"A book review of JavaScript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn","layout":"review","path":"/2013/04/23/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine","date":"2013-04-23T20:30:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I received a copy of Javascript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn this week, and it seemed like perfect timing.  The developers on my team at work have been discussing using Jasmine to automate the testing of Javascript code in our product, and I may be spending a significant amount of time with it soon.  I was hoping to pick up on some tips and tricks, and maybe learn some things about testing.  It ended up being a quick read with some useful tidbits that left me wanting more.</p>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>Javascript Testing with Jasmine is a short little book about testing with Jasmine, a testing framework inspired by the Behavior Driven Development style.  The book is short (only 52 pages), which is appropriate for its limited scope. It’s split into 7 chapters with each chapter comprised of a few pages of example and explanation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is Software testing?</li>\n<li>Jasmine</li>\n<li>Writing good tests</li>\n<li>Matchers in depth</li>\n<li>More Jasmine Features</li>\n<li>Spies</li>\n<li>Using Jasmine with other tools</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What’s it like?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately the book manages to simultaneously feel like its filling space in many spots, and like it missed opportunities to provide value in others. Chapters 4 and 5 for instance fail to say much that is not already in Jasmine’s <a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">“describe by showing”-style documentation.</a> Chapter 1 seems to be searching for interesting things to say about testing, and failed to meaningfully explain the distinction between BDD and generic Test Driven Development.  The section on Jasmine and Coffeescript in Chapter 7 could be succinctly summarized as “Yes you can use Jasmine with Coffeescript”.  At the same time, the book misses opportunities to talk about things like writing testable code, or refactoring existing code to be meaningfully tested with Jasmine. I would have loved to see more about automating testing and fitting it into the development process, or running tests from the command line with phantomJS.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that there’s nothing good here.  I found the explanation of spies to be very helpful, and the detailed documentation-like aspects would be more helpful to a Javascript beginner than Jasmine’s <strong>“show me the code”</strong> docs.  All in all the book serves as a great reference guide for the library.  I’m just not sure how much value it adds compared to a quick Google search.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>In the end this feels like the type of book that made sense before Google took over the Internet.  It provides all the basic how-tos and background information, but fails to provide any deep insight.  If you’re starting a new Javascript BDD project and want a quick reference this may make sense as a quick reference guide, but for most people the information in here can be found just as easily with a little use of your favorite search engine and a trip to the Jasmine docs.</p>\n<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>\n<p>You can get it from Amazon here: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449356370/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449356370&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=JTR6CUZAHM7HLHOQ\">JavaScript Testing with Jasmine (Affiliate Link)</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449356370\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">Jasmine Home Page</a> - Learn more about Jasmine straight from the source</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine\">Medium Equals Message</a> - another review of the book from Chris Webb</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This review is part of the <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/bloggers/\">O’Reilly Blogger Program</a>.

The book does a good job of laying out the basic tools and processes of user-centered design, like usability studies, surveys, and project plans.  It also argues convincingly for the power  of its central points: user focus, preparation, and a structured process.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a deep dive into design theory, this is probably not a book you want.  Rather than dig into abstract design issues, this book instead acts as a survey of the user-centered design landscape, and points you to resources to go deeper if a particular topic catches your interest.  Lowdermilk also does a good job of pointing out examples of the different principles discussed, though for a stretch of the book he appears to be a bit fixated on a small selection of examples, particularly 53 Inc.’s popular iPad app <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend this book for developers who want to open their minds to design considerations and improve their ability to make usable products.  It particularly seems suited for the engineer who knows technically how to implement features and write good code, but is still figuring out how to write applications that delight users.  I’d especially recommend it for team leads or independent developers who are more likely to be able to meet users and be a part of managing requirements.  I think all engineers could benefit from the books emphasis on the users point of view, but the real benefits will come to those who are able to make its suggestions part of the structure of their product workflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449359809/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449359809&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=5XN7KS7FCBFHZ54O\">Buy User-Centered Design on Amazon (Affiliate Link)</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449359809\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"></p>\n<p>This review was part of the <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/bloggers/\">O’Reilly Blogger Program</a>.

His four books on the subjects have had a huge influence on the industry over the last 35 years, a time where data visualization has blossomed as it has moved from a tedious hand drawn task to a computer assisted activity that even middle schoolers can attempt with the software available on most laptops.</p>\n<p>Tufte’s first book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f\">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> is also his most well known and acclaimed book<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It lays out many of the principles that he would go to expand on elsewhere:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on the data</li>\n<li>“Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space”</li>\n<li>Graphics should have <em>integrity</em>.  They shouldn’t mislead the reader.</li>\n<li>Remove unecessary clutter</li>\n<li><em>and more</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book is also beautiful.  Tufte chose to self-publish it so that he could control the exact layout and typography.  He also mixes in many old hand drawn visualizations to mix with a fewer new computer assisted graphics.  The result is stunning, and makes for a very enjoyable read throughout, as there is always something interesting to look at.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 570px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/d2602/typical_page.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.82517482517483%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"A typical page\"\n        title=\"A typical page\"\n        src=\"/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/882a4/typical_page.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/8f870/typical_page.jpg 143w,\n/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/6c669/typical_page.jpg 285w,\n/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/882a4/typical_page.jpg 570w,\n/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/3f8a9/typical_page.jpg 855w,\n/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/0470c/typical_page.jpg 1140w,\n/static/837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6/d2602/typical_page.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I was pleased to find that the book didn’t back up some of my own pre-conceived notions about Tufte and his work.  When I’ve seen him referenced in the past, it has been almost solely in terms of minimalism.  He was an expert witness for fewer colors, fewer lines, less ink.  But his takes here are more nuanced.  He definitely tends towards minimalism, and argues for reducing graphs to their bare minimum ink amount over conforming to familiar forms<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  But his go to example of great data display throughout the book is hardly minimalist.  Minard’s map of Napoleon invading Russia is a complex visualization that tracks the size of an army, time, location and temperature, all in a single image.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 570px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/29114/minards-map.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 48.25174825174825%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Minards Map of Napoleon Invading Russia\"\n        title=\"Minards Map of Napoleon Invading Russia\"\n        src=\"/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/432e7/minards-map.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/a6b04/minards-map.png 143w,\n/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/0e2fe/minards-map.png 285w,\n/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/432e7/minards-map.png 570w,\n/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/77800/minards-map.png 855w,\n/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/b5cea/minards-map.png 1140w,\n/static/a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e/29114/minards-map.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Instead Tufte is really arguing for data efficiency.  Simple things should be displayed simply.  If you have a single number, don’t dress it up in a fancy graph.  Just show the number.  If you have a series of numbers, a table or simple scatter will work fine, no need for a fancy piece of chart “art”.  But when you have truly complex data, a complex visualization can make it accessible in ways that a large page of words and numbers never could on its own.</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f\">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> fun, informative and inspirational.  If you work with data and have never read it, I’d definitely recommend checking it out.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">Amazon named it one of the 100 Best Non-Fiction books of the 20th century<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">Some of that may be a relic of this book being originally written in the 80s before computers, his own work and the work of other similar thinkers greatly increased public awareness of data visualization standards like line and bar charts.<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/03/12/classic-book-review-visual-display/"}}}],"topic":"Book Review"}},
