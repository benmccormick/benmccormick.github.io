Welcome to my blog!</p>\n<p>I’ve been writing here since 2012, and the content has evolved over time, but coalesces into a few different major themes.  To make it easier to navigate through the >180 articles on the site, this page serves as a starting point for exploring those themes.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Engineering Leadership</h4>\n<p>Since 2019, a major theme of the blog has been Engineering Leadership, spanning topics relevant to both managers and individual developers.  Recommended posts include <a href=\"/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/\">Feedback Loops</a>, <a href=\"/2019/06/24/managing-a-distributed-team\">Lessons From Managing A Distributed Team</a>, and <a href=\"/2019/06/03/thinking-values\">Thinking About Values</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/leadership\">All Leadership Posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Architecture</h4>\n<p>I’ve written a range of posts about software design over the years with a focus on the Front End. Recommended posts include <a href=\"/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/\">What’s Involved in Front End Architecture</a>, <a href=\"/2018/02/07/react-confessions/\">React Architecture Confessions</a>, and <a href=\"/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews\">6 Keys To Valuable Code Reviews</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/architecture\">All Architecture Posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>JavaScript</h4>\n<p>JavaScript has been my primary programming language for almost a decade now and I’ve written quite a bit about the language and the libraries around it.  Most of these posts are tactical so the best posts will depend on your interests, but I’ve written several posts about <a href=\"/topics/react\">React and it’s ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/javascript\">All JavaScript Posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Software Career Paths</h4>\n<p>I’ve occasionally written about building a career in the software industry.  The most popular work here has been my pair of 10 things serious devs should know posts: about <a href=\"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/\">JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"/2019/04/15/soft-skills\">soft skills</a> respectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/career\">All Career Posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Productivity</h4>\n<p>Another consistent blog theme has been productive software work.  Some of this is high level, but by far the most popular thing I’ve written here was my <a href=\"/learning-vim-in-2014\">series of posts on being productive in modern Vim</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/topics/productivity\">All Productivity Posts</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Start Here","keywords":null,"category":null,"date":"07/25/2020","path":"/start-here","layout":"page","hideFooter":true,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/start-here"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/start-here","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/404.html","data":{"title":"","path":"/404.html","description":null,"date":null,"category":null}},{"path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","data":{"title":"A note to recruiters","path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","description":null,"date":"2015-06-04T13:42:18+00:00","category":null}},{"path":"/built-with","data":{"title":"Built With","path":"/built-with","description":null,"date":null,"category":null}}]}},
