I‚Äôm going to try writing a bit more soon, but in the meantime wanted to add a quick plug for <a href=\"https://www.kustomer.com/\">Kustomer</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working at Kustomer the past 2 years now ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a crazy rocket ship experience, my first time in a high growth unicorn startup, and we‚Äôre very much <em>just getting started</em> in many ways ‚Äî we‚Äôre looking forward to <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/kustomer-to-join-facebook/\">joining Facebook</a> in the future and all the possibilities that will bring to the table.</p>\n<p>In the here and now though, we‚Äôre building an extremely cool product ‚Äî improving customer service experiences for millions of people by giving agents better info and better tools and making it easier for people to find the info they want themselves without long hold times or delays between emails. We‚Äôve got lots of fun technical challenges as we scale  and work to improve performance of our system at every level (you can get a taste of a few of these at the recently started  <a href=\"https://medium.com/kustomerengineering\">Kustomer Engineering blog</a>).  And we have a fantastic team of engineers who are extremely collaborative and focused on building the best experience for our customers (and their customers).</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre growing like crazy and have a ton of ambitious plans for the future, which means we need more folks.  We‚Äôre hiring for</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://grnh.se/310f16421us\">Engineering Managers</a>: EMs at Kustomer get to lead 1 to 2 teams of 3-7 engineers each of which have a specific product focus.  You get to wear a lot of hats ‚Äî technical leader, domain expert, coach, chaos-tamer, and are pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot.  My 2 years in this role has not always been easy, but it has pushed me to grow more than any other stretch in my career. It‚Äôs a great role for people who like a challenge and thrive on taking on different types of work depending on the day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grnh.se/5765189b1us\">Frontend Engineers</a> at Kustomer get a large amount of autonomy to solve business and user experience problems in their domain of expertise.  Every team has a dedicated Product Manager and Designer that you‚Äôll be collaborating closely with, and we‚Äôre at a fun point in our growth where we‚Äôre taking a product that has grown organically and finding ways to standardize best practices, improve performance, and be more consistent in building great user experiences, not just ‚Äúworking‚Äù experiences.  It adds up to a lot of great technical challenges, and we‚Äôre big enough to have experienced engineers to support and teach while still being small enough to have lots of room for people to come in and own important problems.  Our core stack is React / Redux / TypeScript / Jest / Cypress / Webpack.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grnh.se/3fe8d8871us\">Backend Engineers</a> have similar collaborative and ownership opportunities as FE devs, and get to work in a modern Node microservice based codebase with its own set of interesting technical challenges, especially as we scale the product.  We spend a lot of time thinking about reliable message processing, storing and performantly accessing large amounts of data, and applying machine learning and intelligent automation techniques to customer service data.  Our core stack is Node / Express / Docker / ECS / AWS / MongoDB / ElasticSearch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*All of these roles will eventually be New York City based, but are currently operating remotely.  *</p>\n<p>If any of the above roles sound like the right type of challenge for you please feel free to reach out and apply.  You‚Äôre also welcome to <a href=\"mailto:ben@kustomer.com\">contact me</a> with any questions about working at Kustomer.  Helping bring new awesome people who are excited about what we‚Äôre doing into the company is the most important thing I can do both for them, for Kustomer and for making my own job great, so always happy to talk.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kustomer Is Hiring","keywords":"","category":"meta","date":"2021/09/23","path":"/2021/09/23/kustomer-is-hiring","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2021/09/23/kustomer-is-hiring"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021/09/23/kustomer-is-hiring","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do","data":{"title":"Engineering Management: What do EMs do anyway?","path":"/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do","description":"The activities of an Engineering Manager","date":"2021/02/18","category":"eng-management"}},{"path":"/2021/02/23/ems-handling-accountability","data":{"title":"Engineering Management: Handling Accountability","path":"/2021/02/23/ems-handling-accountability","description":"Owning results when you're not doing the work","date":"2021/02/23","category":"eng-management"}},{"path":"/2021/02/26/ems-how-to-delegate","data":{"title":"Engineering Management: How To Delegate","path":"/2021/02/26/ems-how-to-delegate","description":"How to pass on work successfully","date":"2021/02/26","category":"eng-management"}}]}},
