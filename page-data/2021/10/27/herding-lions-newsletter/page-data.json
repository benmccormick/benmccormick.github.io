Recently I’ve been <em>primarily</em> interested in writing about Engineering Management, my role for the last 3.5 years.  I’ve also been craving more conversation on these topics and want to be more interactive in my writing.</p>\n<p>As an experiment towards those 2 goals, I’m starting a new newsletter <a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org\">Herding Lions</a> focused on Engineering Management.  It will have a mix of shorter pieces from me, interesting links, and questions that I’m hoping to engage with folks on. I’m excited to hear from you there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://herdinglions.benmccormick.org/issues/herding-lions-1-team-output-is-the-smallest-unit-of-productivity-828140\">You can see the first issue and subscribe here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Newsletter: Herding Lions","keywords":"","category":"meta","date":"2021/10/27","path":"/2021/10/27/herding-lions-newsletter","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2021/10/27/herding-lions-newsletter"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021/10/27/herding-lions-newsletter","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2020/09/05/how-teams-go-faster","data":{"title":"How Teams Go Faster","path":"/2020/09/05/how-teams-go-faster","description":"Spot on thoughts from John Cutler","date":"2020/09/05","category":"software-productivity"}},{"path":"/2021/01/01/play-other-positions","data":{"title":"Play Other Positions!","path":"/2021/01/01/play-other-positions","description":"A sports lessons for software careers","date":"2021/01/01","category":"software-productivity"}},{"path":"/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage","data":{"title":"Simple Burnout Triage","path":"/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage","description":"One question to find out whether my pace is sustainable","date":"2020/08/31","category":"eng-management"}}]}},
