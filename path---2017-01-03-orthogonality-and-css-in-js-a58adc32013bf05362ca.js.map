In a well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can change the interface without affecting the database, and swap databases without changing the interface.</p>\\n<p><strong>— The Pragmatic Programmer</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Cohesion is a measure of how well the internal contents of a module relate to each other. A cohesive module is one with a single well defined purpose, where all code in the module is related to that purpose.  A less cohesive module might have multiple purposes, with pieces of code that are completely unrelated to each other.  <a href=\\\"https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/\\\">Robert C. Martin</a> describes this as each module having “a single reason to change”.</p>\\n<p>Coupling is a measure of how dependent different modules are on the internal workings of other modules. In a loosely coupled system, any module can be completely rewritten as long as it exposes the same public interface, without any other modules needing to change.  In a tightly coupled system, changing the internal details of one module may require changes in many other modules.</p>\\n<p>In the real world most systems are not purely orthogonal, and their modules are likely not 100% cohesive and uncoupled.  But striving for these goals is a good approximation of what many people mean when they talk about <em>separation of concerns</em>.</p>\\n<h3>Conways Law</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/2hNzQ0t\\\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> does touch on another application of orthogonality to software engineering:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Have you noticed how some project teams are efficient, with everyone knowing what to do and contributing fully, while the members of other teams are constantly bickering and don’t seem able to get out of each other’s way?</p>\\n<p>Often this is an orthogonality issue. When teams are organized with lots of overlap, members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire team, because any one of them might be affected.</p>\\n<p>How do you organize teams into groups with well-defined responsibilities and minimal overlap? There’s no simple answer. It depends partly on the project and your analysis of the areas of potential change. It also depends on the people you have available. Our preference is to start by separating infrastructure from application. Each major infrastructure component (database, communications interface, middleware layer, and so on) gets its own subteam. Each obvious division of application functionality is similarly divided. Then we look at the people we have (or plan to have) and adjust the groupings accordingly.</p>\\n<p>You can get an informal measure of the orthogonality of a project team’s structure. Simply see how many people need to be involved in discussing each change that is requested. The larger the number, the less orthogonal the group. Clearly, an orthogonal team is more efficient.</p>\\n<p><strong>— The Pragmatic Programmer</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The idea is that teams work more efficiently when each can work in its own areas without having to be bogged down by using another group (or individuals) code, and only interacting with those modules through a well communicated interface.  This is also known as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#x27;s_law\\\">Conway’s Law</a>, which is often used disparagingly but still stands as a true observation about real life code.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations</p>\\n<p><strong>— Conway’s Law</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Although it usually isn’t phrased quite so explicitly, I believe Conway’s law is often related to what people mean when they discuss separation of concerns in front end development.</p>\\n<h3>Boundaries and Interfaces between CSS and JavaScript</h3>\\n<p>Let’s look at 2 examples of how CSS can be structured.  We’ll use a “page view counter” as our example. The element will show the number of users who have viewed the page, and respond to click events by showing a modal with the most popular pages on the site.\\nFirst, for a more traditional example, I’ll show a <a href=\\\"http://marionettejs.com/\\\">Marionette</a> View, with separate CSS. For a more integrated example, I’ll use a React component.</p>\\n<h4>Marionette</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token

different module boundaries. In the Marionette example, we have defined 3 modules, split by code type.  Ignoring the leaky abstractions in the Marionette boundaries <sup id=\\\"fnref-3\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-3\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">3</a></sup>, we can say we have 3 modules with clear singular purpose (styling, behavior,  structure) that use class names and  <code>templateContext</code> as interfaces.  The handlebars file exposes classes, which the CSS uses to style elements and the JavaScript code uses as attachment points for event handling.  The JavaScript view passes data to the template through templateContext.  In the React code we have defined a single module that exports a component as its only external interface. The module’s single purpose could be defined as “rendering a PageViewCounter”.</p>\\n<h3>How do we define module boundaries?</h3>\\n<p>If you’re excited to read which of the above examples is the <em>correct</em> module boundary definition, I’m sorry to disappoint you.  It turns out that module boundaries are more of an art than a science.  Let’s consider each of these examples by the criteria we laid out above.</p>\\n<p>The Marionette modules are <strong>cohesive</strong>.  Each module is single purpose, with a clear reason why it might change.  The React module is also cohesive, as it describes a single atomic component. However, it has more reasons it might change.  We might change that module because of a change in the look and feel of the site, because of a change in the expected behavior of the click event, or because we’re changing the text inside the component.</p>\\n<p>The Marionette modules are not quite <strong>decoupled</strong>.  While this CSS doesn’t nest selectors and we don’t have any explicit dependencies on the HTML structure, it is still written in a way that assumes <code>.page-view-counter__title</code> and <code>.page-view-counter__counter</code> will be direct children of <code>.page-view-counter</code>.  So changing the “internal details” of the Handlebars file by adding an extra element around those children would break the CSS. While the modules are not completely decoupled from each other, they don’t rely on any private details of other modules or global styles and can be used together as a reusable component.  The React module is similarly decoupled from the rest of the system, and as a single module faces no internal coupling issues.</p>\\n<p>Both components should be <strong>orthogonal</strong> from the rest of the system, even though the Marionette modules may be less orthogonal internally.  The question of how they meet a Conway’s law style of orthogonality depends on a team.  If your team has designers, and developers separately working on style/structure and behavior, the Marionette version may allow for more efficient division of labor, with communication centering on class based communication.  If you instead have a group of polyglot front end developers who implement mocks from designers across all 3 areas, the React version will instead present a simpler implementation that maps better to your team, with the focus on interfaces across different components.  </p>\\n<p>In the end decisions like this are an exercise in understanding context and preferences.  What will make your team productive? You can accept the coupling of the first example in order to gain the benefits of small focused modules.  Or you can take the larger scope of the React component in exchange for keeping all information relevant to a component in one place.  Are you making single developers responsible for a set of components?  Or are they responsible for behavior generally, with design handled by someone else? Make the decisions that work for your project.</p>\\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/2hNzQ0t\\\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> is a great book.

But striving for these goals is a good approximation of what many people mean when they talk about <em>separation of concerns</em>.</p>\\n<h3>Conways Law</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/2hNzQ0t\\\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> does touch on another application of orthogonality to software engineering:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Have you noticed how some project teams are efficient, with everyone knowing what to do and contributing fully, while the members of other teams are constantly bickering and don’t seem able to get out of each other’s way?</p>\\n<p>Often this is an orthogonality issue. When teams are organized with lots of overlap, members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire team, because any one of them might be affected.</p>\\n<p>How do you organize teams into groups with well-defined responsibilities and minimal overlap? There’s no simple answer. It depends partly on the project and your analysis of the areas of potential change. It also depends on the people you have available. Our preference is to start by separating infrastructure from application. Each major infrastructure component (database, communications interface, middleware layer, and so on) gets its own subteam. Each obvious division of application functionality is similarly divided. Then we look at the people we have (or plan to have) and adjust the groupings accordingly.</p>\\n<p>You can get an informal measure of the orthogonality of a project team’s structure. Simply see how many people need to be involved in discussing each change that is requested. The larger the number, the less orthogonal the group. Clearly, an orthogonal team is more efficient.</p>\\n<p><strong>— The Pragmatic Programmer</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The idea is that teams work more efficiently when each can work in its own areas without having to be bogged down by using another group (or individuals) code, and only interacting with those modules through a well communicated interface.  This is also known as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#x27;s_law\\\">Conway’s Law</a>, which is often used disparagingly but still stands as a true observation about real life code.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations</p>\\n<p><strong>— Conway’s Law</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Although it usually isn’t phrased quite so explicitly, I believe Conway’s law is often related to what people mean when they discuss separation of concerns in front end development.</p>\\n<h3>Boundaries and Interfaces between CSS and JavaScript</h3>\\n<p>Let’s look at 2 examples of how CSS can be structured.  We’ll use a “page view counter” as our example. The element will show the number of users who have viewed the page, and respond to click events by showing a modal with the most popular pages on the site.\\nFirst, for a more traditional example, I’ll show a <a href=\\\"http://marionettejs.com/\\\">Marionette</a> View, with separate CSS. For a more integrated example, I’ll use a React component.</p>\\n<h4>Marionette</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token

different module boundaries. In the Marionette example, we have defined 3 modules, split by code type.  Ignoring the leaky abstractions in the Marionette boundaries <sup id=\\\"fnref-3\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-3\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">3</a></sup>, we can say we have 3 modules with clear singular purpose (styling, behavior,  structure) that use class names and  <code>templateContext</code> as interfaces.  The handlebars file exposes classes, which the CSS uses to style elements and the JavaScript code uses as attachment points for event handling.  The JavaScript view passes data to the template through templateContext.  In the React code we have defined a single module that exports a component as its only external interface. The module’s single purpose could be defined as “rendering a PageViewCounter”.</p>\\n<h3>How do we define module boundaries?</h3>\\n<p>If you’re excited to read which of the above examples is the <em>correct</em> module boundary definition, I’m sorry to disappoint you.  It turns out that module boundaries are more of an art than a science.  Let’s consider each of these examples by the criteria we laid out above.</p>\\n<p>The Marionette modules are <strong>cohesive</strong>.  Each module is single purpose, with a clear reason why it might change.  The React module is also cohesive, as it describes a single atomic component. However, it has more reasons it might change.  We might change that module because of a change in the look and feel of the site, because of a change in the expected behavior of the click event, or because we’re changing the text inside the component.</p>\\n<p>The Marionette modules are not quite <strong>decoupled</strong>.  While this CSS doesn’t nest selectors and we don’t have any explicit dependencies on the HTML structure, it is still written in a way that assumes <code>.page-view-counter__title</code> and <code>.page-view-counter__counter</code> will be direct children of <code>.page-view-counter</code>.  So changing the “internal details” of the Handlebars file by adding an extra element around those children would break the CSS. While the modules are not completely decoupled from each other, they don’t rely on any private details of other modules or global styles and can be used together as a reusable component.  The React module is similarly decoupled from the rest of the system, and as a single module faces no internal coupling issues.</p>\\n<p>Both components should be <strong>orthogonal</strong> from the rest of the system, even though the Marionette modules may be less orthogonal internally.  The question of how they meet a Conway’s law style of orthogonality depends on a team.  If your team has designers, and developers separately working on style/structure and behavior, the Marionette version may allow for more efficient division of labor, with communication centering on class based communication.  If you instead have a group of polyglot front end developers who implement mocks from designers across all 3 areas, the React version will instead present a simpler implementation that maps better to your team, with the focus on interfaces across different components.  </p>\\n<p>In the end decisions like this are an exercise in understanding context and preferences.  What will make your team productive? You can accept the coupling of the first example in order to gain the benefits of small focused modules.  Or you can take the larger scope of the React component in exchange for keeping all information relevant to a component in one place.  Are you making single developers responsible for a set of components?  Or are they responsible for behavior generally, with design handled by someone else? Make the decisions that work for your project.</p>\\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://amzn.to/2hNzQ0t\\\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> is a great book.
