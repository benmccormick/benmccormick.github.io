            "html_content": "<p><em>How do we get better faster?</em>  It’s amazing to consider the amount of money, thought and effort that has gone into solving that one simple problem in software development over the past 2 decades.  Here’s a small sample of buzzwords, trends and methodology that are concerned with reducing the time between making a change to software and seeing the results:</p>\n<p><strong>Agile -</strong> Agile is all about delivering working software sooner, so that you produce value faster and learn lessons quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD) -</strong> Test driven development is a process designed to let you know as soon as possible when a change has had the desired effect during development, and also sets up the conditions under which you know as soon as possible when a change has had an undesirable side effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Devops -</strong> Devops has been a push over the past decade to automate and control all parts of the software creation, deployment and maintenance life cycle.  Automation like continuous integration servers that run your test after every commit, chat bots that alert you based on site performance metrics, and servers that automatically build a copy of every branch for testing in a virtual machine are all examples of Devops being used to speed up the point when you know that a change worked or didn’t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Experience -</strong> This is a more recent buzzword that I’ve seen thrown around a lot in the JavaScript community, talking about improving developer tools.  Developer tool features like hot reloading, nicer error messages, specialized debugging and profiling tools, and fast build times all fight this same problem of getting a result as fast as possible.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Loops</h3>\n<p>All of these tools are concerned with <em>feedback loops</em>, the process by which developers, designers and product managers make changes, learn about the effect of those changes, and then iterate.  Teams with slow feedback loops spend a lot of time planning and thinking about every change, making sure to get everything right. They feel the cost distinctly each time they make a mistake, and it generally leads to a more cautious mindset.  Teams with fast feedback loops can plan too.  But they also have the option of taking a more experimental attitude and learning from their attempts. This can happen at multiple scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>developer</strong> can try out 5 different CSS rules in the UI in a few seconds if his UI is hot reloading and he doesn’t have to wait for a whole SCSS bundle to recompile</li>\n<li>A <strong>QA team</strong> can immediately know if somebody pushes a change that would breaks tests if they have a CI server set up to run tests against every new commit to each branch.</li>\n<li>A <strong>product team</strong> can see quickly that a new feature is problematic if he’s able to see detailed analytics on usage, instead of waiting to do enough user interviews to get a full picture</li>\n<li>A <strong>company</strong> can change direction if they ship an MVP early instead of attempting to wait and release the perfect product</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Your Loops</h3>\n<p>As a developer who wants to make your product better, one of your best power moves is finding ways to speed up feedback loops.  Here are 4 suggestions for how to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ask Questions Early:</strong> One of the most important feedback loops for a developer is between yourself and the individual in charge of defining what you’re building.  If you simply take requirements from your PM/Manager/Lead/Designer/CEO/Client and go off and build your giant amazing piece of beautiful software, without any clarification, there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get to build it again, this time twice as fast without the budget.  Asking clarifying questions early prevents you wasting your time and exposes understanding gaps and technical barriers while there’s still a chance to deal with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Feedback as you go:</strong> Similarly, anytime you have a chance to get feedback on work while it is still in process from somebody who might object in the end, do it.  This means instead of building everything at once, work on smaller chunks.  This often takes time and thought, but the earlier you create <em>complete</em> chunks of code that can be evaluated and ideally shipped on their own, the more likely you are to ship something great in the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your environment:</strong> Have you spent time figuring out how to work as efficiently as possible?  Have you done it recently?  If not it might be worth re-evaluating your setup on a quarterly basis or so, figuring out what tools you can use to get quicker feedback, and also learning the shortcuts, tricks and new features for the tools that you do use.</li>\n<li><strong>Ship Code:</strong> Ultimately the best feedback comes when people are using what you’ve written.  Whether that’s compliments, bug reports, feature requests, anger or viral adoption, shipping will tell you things that you would never have been certain of while iterating on your own.  If you’re struggling to get code out, always fix that first.</li>\n</ol>",

Some of it is CSS specific but the general ideas of tackling the important bits, experimenting with changes, and using tools as much as possible to catch regressions apply across the board.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/a-one-year-pwa-retrospective-f4a2f4129e05\">A one year PWA retrospective | Zach Argyle</a></p>\n<p>TL;DR: Pinterest saw great results from supplementing their mobile apps with a PWA web app.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/mission-improve-the-web-ecosystem-for-developers-3a8b55f46411\">Mission: Improve the Web Ecosystem for Developers | Dion Almaer</a></p>\n<p>I don’t know Dion, but this was a wonderful list of challenges that people looking to improve the web platform might want to tackle.  I’m excited to see people tackling this stuff.  I’m especially interested in what better tools for creating performant sites would look like.</p>\n<h3>Technical Deep Dives</h3>\n<p>These are long technical articles, and more back end focused then I usually write about on this blog but both touch on things I’m interested in and I found them fascinating.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/\">Centrifuge: a reliable system for delivering billions of events per day || Calvin French-Owen</a></p>\n<p>I had to build an event handling system like this a few years ago, and it’s fun to see how the optimal solution changed for Segment as they scaled.  On the backend designs that make no sense for small projects start becoming very real options as a project scales.  That’s why it’s always worth having some skepticism over the idea that because AppAmaGooFaceSoft are using a technology it must be “best in class” and we should use it in our small 20 person development team that is facing problems of a completely different scale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/\">ripgrep is faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift} | Andrew Gallant</a></p>\n<p>This piece is structured as a comparison of performance between cli file search tools, but the cool part is the deep insight into text search algorithms and performance tricks littered throughout the benchmark discussions.  It’s fascinating to see how heavily optimized for speed these tools are.  Also, I’ve been using Ack for 5 years even though I know it’s not the fastest tool for searching, because for me it was always “fast enough” to avoid searching.  But ripgrep appears to be dramatically enough faster in the relatively rare circumstances where I’m searching truly large directories of files, that I may finally be up for converting to a new tool.</p>\n<h3>Book Review</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2mPr3zV\">Front-End Reactive Architectures | Luca Mezzalira</a></p>\n<p>I’ve been very excited to check out this book since I first saw the title pre-release.  I finally had a chance to purchase and read it last month, and I’m sad to report that I had fallen prey to the classic mistake of judging a book by it’s cover.  I had hoped that this would be a deep dive into architecture and how we structure front end applications, and how reactive programming concepts can impact that.  There’s a real dearth of quality high level UI architecture resources out there, so I was genuinely excited about this.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the book is structured more like a series of loosely related blog posts, first with an overview of older architectural models like MVC, MVP and MVVM, followed by sections looking at several different libraries that use reactive principles: RxJS, Cycle, and MobX.  The latter sections focused more on the nuts and bolts of using the libraries to create simple example apps and less on the impact that using them would have on a large application.  So this is a good book if you want to see some simple code examples of how these libraries work in practice.  But I’m still waiting for a great high level front-end architecture book.</p>",

            "html_content": "<p>Stop me if this sounds familiar: you see a bug on your site.  You want to know what’s going on.  You fire up the developer tools, put a breakpoint in the area you think is a problem, and… the error doesn’t occur while it’s being debugged.  Probably it’s a timing issue, but I’ve also seen situations where pausing on certain breakpoints will actually cause a browser tab to freeze up.  Whatever weirdness you’re dealing with, you can’t get a breakpoint running in the right spot to see the error.  These are known colloquially as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug\">Heisenbugs</a>, bugs that disappear when measured.  Ideally at this point you would add some logging, but if the issue is on production, and you don’t know exactly what needs to be logged, that could delay a fix by an unacceptable amount.</p>\n<p>I actually ran into this last night, and decided to test out a tactic I’d heard about in a <a href=\"https://changelog.com/jsparty/30\">recent JS Party episode</a>.  Did you know that you can use conditional break points to add temporary logging to a live application?</p>\n<p>Conditional breakpoints are a browser debugger feature where you set a breakpoint, and specify a condition.  The breakpoint only stops the program execution when that condition is truthy.  Here’s a video describing the feature in Firefox:</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVPlMhfrMwM\" frameborder=\"0\" encrypted-media\"=\"\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>Conditional breakpoints are useful when you’re running through a code path many times during program execution, but you want to stop during a specific run.  But they can also be used to solve our heisenbug problem.  Because the conditional breakpoint executes the code inside of it in the context of the line we’re trying to break on, we can actually put logging inside the breakpoint.</p>\n<p><a href=\"log-example.png\">An example of a console.log inside a breakpoint</a></p>\n<p>That <code class=\"language-text\">console.log</code> will execute, and because <code class=\"language-text\">console.log</code> returns false, the breakpoint will never actually stop.  It’s a heisenbug-safe version of watching variables when you’re at a breakpoint, and there’s no redeploys required.</p>",

Go is a statically typed, compiled language useful for systems programming, which makes it a nice complement to my 2 primary languages, JavaScript and Python.  To help myself learn, I decided to revisit the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/11/28/sieveoferatosthenes/\">Sieve of Eratosthenes problem</a> that I wrote about last year.  I already had implementations in Python and JavaScript, and thought it would be interesting to see how the code and performance compared.</p>\n<p>As a refresher, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for generating prime numbers by iterating through numbers and marking all multiples of primes we encounter as not prime.  The original algorithm is useful for finding small primes up to a limit, but will eventually consume infinite memory for computers or infinite time for humans.  I used a modified algorithm in my JavaScript implementation that only marks numbers as they become relevant, you can read more details about the problem in <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/11/28/sieveoferatosthenes/\">the original post</a> but using the JavaScript implementation to generate the 1 millionth prime looks like this:</p>\n<div

a direct 1 to 1 translation of the JavaScript code.  In Go, generators are created using channels and goroutines.  Goroutines are special functions that can run concurrently to the main thread in Go, and channels are a mechanism for passing data from them, that block the goroutine until the message is received.  So a goroutine that will pass multiple messages through to a channel is essentially equivalent to a Python or JavaScript generator using <code class=\"language-text\">yield</code>.  Beyond that, most of the syntax difference is around the ceremony required for using slices in Go , and checking whether an item exists in a map.  Slices are Go’s version of a dynamic length array/list, they require an <code class=\"language-text\">append</code> function which returns a new slice to add a value.  Go doesn’t have a <code class=\"language-text\">has</code> method or equivalent on it’s map types.  Instead when you attempt to access a value from a map, the map returns 2 values: the received value or the “zero value” of the map’s type and a boolean saying whether the access was successful.  So you have code like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"go\">\n      <pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\">commits <span class=\"token operator\">:=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token builtin\">int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"example\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">100</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> val<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> has_val <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> commits<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"example\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>  <span class=\"token comment\">// val == 100, has_val == true</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> val2<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> has_val2 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> commits<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"example2\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>  <span class=\"token comment\">// val == 0, has_val == false</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So does all of this ceremony buy us any performance?  Only a minimal amount in this case.  After timing each script several time the Python code averaged out to 23 seconds, the JavaScript averaged 10.5 seconds, and the Go version averaged 9.5 seconds.  It’s the fastest, but only by minimal amounts over the JavaScript.  A good reminder that the algorithm will generally matter more than the programming language for many things, and also that large companies have optimized the heck out of JavaScript in recent years to the point where it’s pretty competitive on single threaded performance for many tasks.</p>",

I don’t think they’re good for my productivity, but I enjoy the people I work with and build more connections with coworkers in an open office than I did when I worked in cubicles. I also find that articles like this tend not to fully grapple with the alternatives.  Most companies aren’t mostly remote like Basecamp, and budgeting private offices for all developers is not realistic (especially for the startups called out in this piece due to unknown scaling needs).  So it’s remote, open office or cubicle farms, and all three have their detractors.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94\">Designing for accessibility is not that hard | Pablo Stanley</a></p>\n<p>I’m embarrassingly ignorant about accessibility concerns, so this was a helpful article for me.

Interestingly it looks like early 2013, right before the new iOS7 look and feel launched, was the peak point for interface diversity and distinctiveness, as each of these apps had evolved along their own paths.  iOS7 imposed a level of standardization and sameness, and I think apps are just now re-evolving to the point of having truly distinct brand identities on top of that new base.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<p>I’ve been on vacation this week, so here are 2 quicky non-tech book reviews:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2L4uGQp\">Golden Days: West’s Lakers, Steph’s Warriors, and the California Dreamers Who Reinvented Basketball | Jack McCallum</a></p>\n<p>This was a fun book for basketball lovers.  The sections on Jerry West and the Lakers of the 60s and 70s are more detailed and colorful than the alternating chapters on the modern Warriors, but both are fun, and those interested in how modern Silicon Valley has interacted with the rise of the most popular basketball team in the world will find some interesting tidbits in the modern chapters as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Jj6vJ2\">American Gods | Neil Gaiman</a></p>\n<p>A fantasy novel set in modern America.  This one was too crude for me to recommend unreservedly, but it contains a huge number of cool images and ideas, and I don’t regret reading it.</p>",

I’ve found that I enjoy this teaching style, I also loved <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KHf3Ps\">Death By Meeting</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KXOkxh\">The Goal</a>, which employee the same style.  The beauty of fables is the way they allow you to soak into a scenario, and connect it to your own experiences and relationships.  Then as the principles the author wants to teach unfold, they take advantage of those connections to spark ideas for application.  At least that’s the theory.</p>\n<p>The Five Dysfunctions is of course, about how teams go wrong.  I won’t spoil the contents too much, but ultimately, team failures aren’t about technique or distinct decisions, but human beings and how we relate to each other.  This book both clearly defines a set of those problems, and then gives concrete suggestions for improving a team when they’re present.  It’s a classic, and I found it as thought provoking as I expected.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to better understand how teams work, and how they fail.</p>",
