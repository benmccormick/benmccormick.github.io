It aims to be a more minimalist take on expanding class capabilities (primarily adding private state syntax) than other proposals that have come along over the last few years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/wycats/b1c96c67074396a239abd60f55087adc\">thoughts.md | Yehuda Katz</a> - This was a response to the JS Classes 1.1 proposal from Yehuda Katz, the lead proponent of adding decorator syntax for JavaScript classes.  He compares the new proposal to existing proposals, with specific concerns for how it would interop with decorators.</p>\n<h3>Computer Science and Software Engineering</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/basecs\">basecs | Vaidehi Joshi</a> - While I’ve been starting to consider how to explain CS concepts for front end developers without a CS background, I found this excellent beginner set of CS articles written by Vaidehi Joshi on Medium over the past year.  Worth diving into, especially if you like fun visuals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.nrwl.io/the-3-skills-that-helped-me-become-a-better-software-engineer-8b06a37becf3\">The 3 Skills That Helped Me Become a Better Software Engineer | Victor Savkin</a> - This is worth sharing solely for the advice about mental models.  In my experience the ability to think in abstractions (and understand when you need to dig deeper) is one of the biggest hurdles in programming when trying to grow from a beginner to a more advanced software engineer.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<p>I’ve been working through a goal to read 30 books in a year, and have worked through a few more books recently.  Here are two good ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Gbh9R2\">The Martian | Andy Weir</a> - Yes I know I’m 3 years late on this one.  But I’m sure there are other lost souls like me who entered 2018 without reading this book.  If you love tech and science (and I’m guessing you do if you’re reading this), you should find a way to read The Martian.  My first thought when I started reading it was “This is great”.  My second thought was “How in the world did this end up becoming a Hollywood Blockbuster starring Matt Damon?“.  The Martian is unapologetically geeky, and it is “real science” fiction, with a very human core. I loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2G1h9ah\">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a> - This was a recommendation from my manager, and is a great read for anyone who wants to improve the meetings they’re in at work.  It’s written in a “business fable” style, with a story serving to illustrate the principles it is trying to teach.  One thing I love is that it tells the story of the principles being implemented from a lower rung employee, rather than a top-down executive driven approach, so hopefully it can be inspirational to you even if you feel like you wouldn’t be able to change your meeting culture even if you knew what to do.</p>",

            "html_content": "<p>A few weeks ago, I asked for input on the idea of <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/\">resources on Computer Science for front end developers</a>.  Because there was a decent amount of interest, I’m planning on fleshing out the idea a bit with a small series of posts on CS basics.  These posts will cover some concepts that would usually be covered in an intro level CS course.  If folks find them helpful I may move on to more advanced topics like Data Structures &#x26; Algorithms, the software abstractions that modern web development is built on top of, and other math/theory topics.</p>\n<p>With these posts I’m not trying to replicate a CS intro course and won’t cover everything.  I’m not trying to teach anyone how to program.  Instead I’m covering the ideas and details behind concepts that FE devs may have learned by doing but never been exposed to from an theory point of view.  I am not an academic, so the goal will be to keep a casual tone focused on the practical implications of theory to a Front End developer.  If I’m successful, these posts will give you a better set of mental models when working to understand the code you’re reading and writing every day.  That’s plenty of throat-clearing, so now I’m going to jump into one of the most fundamental building blocks of any programming language: variables.</p>\n<h3>What are Variables? (Not as obvious as it sounds)</h3>\n<p>Variables in programming languages are symbols that we assign to represent a value.  That seems simple enough, but that sentence is too vague to properly account for the complexity of reality.  When dealing with variables in the real world, it’s important to have a good mental model of how they really behave, or you may become confused by how your programs act.  For instance if you believe that variables are always live references to whatever other variable they were assigned to, you may be surprised by the behavior of this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\na <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// prints 1</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>and if you believe that variables always point to a unique value that is created when you assign to them, you might be surprised by this one:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\na<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// prints [1, 2, 3, 4]</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Knowing generally that a variable points to a value is a great start.  But a proper understanding of the model that a programming language uses for variables can help you avoid subtle bugs.</p>\n<h3>How Variables Work</h3>\n<p>Here’s the most important sentence for gaining a proper understanding of how variables work: “A variable points to a location in memory.”  Explaining how memory is organized and allocated is outside the scope of this post, but for now it’s sufficient to just understand memory as a long list of blocks, each of which has it’s own address.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/memory1-13e99029e891d957a0e14cbc732767cc-792e8.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

When a function is called, the argument variables are assigned to point at the memory address of the value passed into the function.</p>\n<h3>Mutable vs Immutable Variables</h3>\n<p>This memory address stuff can seem pretty abstract, and not very useful, but it’s a great gateway to understanding more practical topics.  A while back I wrote a post about <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2016/06/04/what-are-mutable-and-immutable-data-structures-2/\">mutable and immutable data</a>.  If you’re unfamiliar with the concepts you can read the original article for background.  But basically, JavaScript values are divided into 2 categories: primitives like booleans, strings, and numbers which are immutable, and objects which are mutable.  Immutable primitives can’t be changed, when they’re operated on they can only be replaced with a new value.  Mutable objects can be changed in place.  That “in place” qualifier can seem a bit hazy without understanding the underlying memory situation, but now we can explain this more clearly: the value for a primitive will never change within a memory location, a variable will instead have to point to a new location in memory.  A mutable variable can be modified without changing it’s location in memory.

So the following code works in a way that people might not expect if they don’t understand variables.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> c <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">sameReference</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> d <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">sameReference</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> b<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// true</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> c<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// false</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>a <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> d<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// true</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Modifying objects in functions modifies them outside of the function scope</strong> - This is a pretty common gotcha for folks who don’t understand variables and memory.

Both help with issues around variable scoping<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, but the difference between the two can seem rather confusing.  It seems like <code>const</code> might indicate a constant value that can’t be changed.  But mutable values declared with const can in fact change:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> arr <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\narr<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>arr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// [1, 2, 3, 4]</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Instead <code>const</code> is once again about memory and reference assignment.  A variable that is assigned through const can’t be reassigned to a new location in memory.  So if it is pointed to a primitive like <code>123</code> or <code>true</code>, it truly is a constant, because the value can’t change. But when it’s pointed to a mutable value, it’s reference won’t change, and it will always <code>===</code> any variables that have been assigned to it, but the actual contents of that memory can change.</p>\n<h3>Feedback is lovely</h3>\n<p>This is a new series, and I’d love to hear whether it is helpful for you, and any other topics you’d like to see covered.

You can see the original thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336/status/974670479905705984\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This morning I saw the following tweet:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*TC39 proposes Array.flatten feature that breaks code that was working fine for 10 years*<br>&quot;IT&#39;S THEIR FAULT FOR DOING NONSTANDARD STUFF&quot;<br><br>*TC39 proposes changing classes feature not yet in standard*<br>&quot;IT&#39;S NOT FAIR I WROTE CODE USING THAT&quot;</p>&mdash; Dave Methvin (@davemethvin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davemethvin/status/974037352384430080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<p>The tweet refers to <a href=\"https://github.com/allenwb/js-classes-1.1\">this proposal</a> for replacing a number of other proposals for augmenting JS’s current class syntax, as well as recent backlash on twitter over <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-flatMap/pull/56\">a proposal </a> to not use flatten or flatmap for future JS standard syntax due to their previous use in mootools.  </p>\n<p>Because people have been using Babel or other tools to transpile their code and use the proposed class syntax today, it would be frustrating for many devs if the proposal shifted under them.  I’ve been there.  And thus, story time:</p>\n<p>A few years ago I used a polyfill for a browser API that wasn’t yet fully supported in all browsers.  And I used it in production code.  Browser support didn’t pick up nearly as quickly as I expected, and then the spec changed.  Supporting that code has caused me problems repeatedly since, and there isn’t a lot of support, given that the syntax isn’t standardized.  Because <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/\">I am working with limited resources</a> I  still haven’t been able to get rid of the polyfill code completely.  It’s baked into one of the most critical portions of my production application.  And so I’ve had to live with it and deal with some of it’s non-ideal aspects for a long time.  Since then I’ve avoided putting anything in production that isn’t in a spec.  And I have absolutely no regrets about that.</p>\n<p><strong>The lesson I’ve learned:</strong> Polyfilling a partially supported spec for compatibility is fine.  Playing around with new proposals is fine (and actually a great idea if you want to influence the future of the language).  But I never want to use polyfills/transpiling for a <em>proposed spec</em> in production code. And yes that means no decorators/class properties/pipeline operators in my code for now.  But that’s ok.  JavaScript is a pretty decent language today.  A little patience will help you in the end.  Even libraries like MobX that encourage the use of “future specs” will still work without them if they’re reasonably well maintained.</p>\n<h3>Why Does This Happen?</h3>\n<p>To some folks the lesson of “Don’t use language features that aren’t standardized yet” probably looks obvious.  So why does this happen? I think there’s a community/culture aspect to some of this.  For instance, many of the early adopters of React really wanted to push the language forward to achieve better developer experience, and were more likely to propose and advocate for new syntax.  This was fine for them, because many of these folks were either</p>\n<p>a. Employees at large companies who had the resources to support whatever code extensions they wanted, and dedicate time to a large refactor if they got it wrong (not typical of most devs)\nb. Consultants/teachers who are always trying to stay on the bleeding edge for teaching purposes and who don’t build projects intended to be maintained long term (not typical of most devs)\nc. Involved in the language standards process and experimenting with new syntax for the purpose of influencing the language, rather than writing production code with it (not typical of most devs)</p>\n<p>Because of this, the need to compile JS for JSX purposes anyway and the heavy emphasis in the early React community on rethinking best practices, I’ve seen a lot more of this type of pre-standardization use of features in the React community than elsewhere.  The Ember community for instance doesn’t seem to have the same problems. But it started with early adopters in React, and spread when folks who were less informed about the standards process cargo-culted the code examples.  So here we are.</p>\n<h3>My suggestions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Learn about the ECMAScript standards process.</strong>  <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/\">This post</a> can get you started.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t use non-standard code in production.</strong>  It just isn’t worth the headaches you may get later.</li>\n</ol>",

            "html_content": "<p>If you have any interest at all in data visualization, you can’t get very far learning about it without hearing the name Edward Tufte.  His four books on the subjects have had a huge influence on the industry over the last 35 years, a time where data visualization has blossomed as it has moved from a tedious hand drawn task to a computer assisted activity that even middle schoolers can attempt with the software available on most laptops.</p>\n<p>Tufte’s first book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f\">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> is also his most well known and acclaimed book<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It lays out many of the principles that he would go to expand on elsewhere:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on the data</li>\n<li>“Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space”</li>\n<li>Graphics should have <em>integrity</em>.  They shouldn’t mislead the reader.</li>\n<li>Remove unecessary clutter</li>\n<li><em>and more</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book is also beautiful.  Tufte chose to self-publish it so that he could control the exact layout and typography.  He also mixes in many old hand drawn visualizations to mix with a fewer new computer assisted graphics.  The result is stunning, and makes for a very enjoyable read throughout, as there is always something interesting to look at.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"A typical page\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-da4c7.jpg 143w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-1d39e.jpg 285w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg 570w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-9d77e.jpg 855w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-e356a.jpg 1140w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-4208b.jpg 1710w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I was pleased to find that the book didn’t back up some of my own pre-conceived notions about Tufte and his work.  When I’ve seen him referenced in the past, it has been almost solely in terms of minimalism.  He was an expert witness for fewer colors, fewer lines, less ink.  But his takes here are more nuanced.

            "html_content": "<p>Rather than posting random stuff that popped up this week like usual, I wanted to instead post a set of “classic” links instead. The theme this week is Learning React.  Here are some of the links that helped me to learn different React concepts as I was first tackling it.  Note that these are links that helped me learn the concepts behind different parts of the React ecosystem.  Some are intro level, while some assume basic familiarity with the concepts they discuss.</p>\n<h3>The Motivation Behind React</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html\">Thinking In React</a> - It’s strange, but I never expect the official docs for a project to be the best explanation of their purpose.  Official documentation tends to lean towards the “how” rather than the “why”, and the motivations of the maintainers aren’t always the motivations of the community anyway.  But this article from the React docs remains the best explanations of the problems that React is solving as well as the way that it solves them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui\">Pure UI</a> - Even moreso than <em>Thinking in React</em>, this 2015 article nails the paradigm shift that React represented.  The power of UI as a function of data has been the biggest change I’ve experienced in my career building UIs, and this article was like a message in the bottle from the future when it was first written 3 years ago.</p>\n<h3>Flux, MobX and Redux</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-guide-to-flux-6157355ab207\">A cartoon guide to Flux | Lin Clark</a> - This was a nice early run through of the Flux concepts.  Lin Clark is one of the best “front end explainers” out there, and she does a good job here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-fundamental-principles-behind-mobx-7a725f71f3e8\">The Fundamental Principles Behind MobX | Michael Weststrate</a> - Like most of the other links here, this is a theory link, not a practical introduction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux\">Getting Started With Redux | Dan Abramov on Egghead.io </a> - Like <em>Thinking with React</em>, this is a great introduction to a library that starts with the problems to be solved and shows how a new library solves that problem, rather than simply telling you what a tool does.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367\">You Might Not Need Redux | Dan Abramov</a> - Another helpful article for understanding what Redux is and isn’t solving for, helpful if you’re trying to decide whether to include it in a project.</p>\n<h3>React Patterns</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns\">Advanced React Component Patterns | Kent C Dobbs on Egghead.io</a> - This is my one paid content link, but its so good that its worth sharing.  This was a fantastic course that covers patterns like Higher Order Components, Render props and more.  It discusses both the implementation concerns and motivation behind each.</p>\n<h3>Future Stuff</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b\">React’s New Context API | Kent C Dobbs</a> - This is fairly recent, but Kent Dobbs gave a great explanation of React’s new context API</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\">Sneak Peek: Beyond React 16 | React Blog</a> - I posted this last week as well, but this is a great inspirational talk on where React is going next.</p>",

I’m still processing through this, and how I can use it, but Suspense seems like something that will make dealing with async data much easier in React.  Loading states are something I deal with all the time, and having cleaner primitives for expressing them will be a big win.</p>\n<h3>Programming Tools</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.olioapps.com/blog/the-lost-art-of-the-makefile/\">The Lost Art of the Makefile |Jesse Hallett</a> - An interesting case for using Makefiles to manage modern JavaScript builds on projects that don’t need the overhead of webpack.  I don’t think this is going to be the next trend in JS, but I am interested to see where the JS world leans next when it comes to task automation.  When I started using JS, I saw people using Make or tools from other language ecosystems to build projects.  Grunt and Gulp really changed that and moved folks towards using the node ecosystem for task automation.  Now the community seems to have settled on webpack for build related tasks, and npm scripts for everything else.  I’m all good with webpack for builds, it’s complicated but powerful.  But npm scripts are frustrating as a task automation solution.  There’s no ability to comment, and long operations in nested JSON strings are a bit unwieldy.  I’d love to see some standardization on something more like make that allows comments and powerful task composition.</p>\n<h3>Computer Science In JS</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://raganwald.com/2018/02/23/forde.html\">Forde’s Tenth Rule, or, “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and ❤️ the State Machine” | Reginald Braithwaite</a> - A really nice explanation of state machines, and how they can be used in JavaScript development.  The article is written at a very conceptual level and really explains the topic well.  I was thinking afterwards about how the state machine concepts reminded me of Redux, and fortunately I found another link that expanded on that connection…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-model-the-behavior-of-redux-apps-using-statecharts-5e342aad8f66\">How to model the behavior of Redux apps using statecharts | Luca Matteis</a> - I hadn’t heard of statecharts before reading this, but they look like a really interesting tool for talking about large systems.  I’d be really curious to play with the redux middleware for automatically generating them and see if the artifacts it produces are useful.</p>\n<h3>Non-Tech</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/opinion/eyesight-going-blind.html\">Am I Going Blind? | Frank Bruni</a> - This is absurdly well written, and it hit me personally since the idea of going blind has always been a personal fear of mine.  I think everybody has their one bad thing that they irrationally fear will happen to them and this is mine.  The article was good perspective in mutliple ways, reminding me how blessed I am and how resilient humans (and our bodies) are.

No features have been confirmed yet, but worth a bookmark.  He also has links to his detailed articles about the various candidate features if you’re interested in seeing where JavaScript is headed next.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-javascript-supply-chain-paradox-sri-csp-and-trust-in-third-party-libraries/\">The JavaScript Supply Chain Paradox: SRI, CSP and Trust in Third Party Libraries | Troy Hunt</a> - This is a great reminder on why including scripts from 3rd party domains is a risky business, and how to do it securely.</p>\n<h4>Computer Science</h4>\n<p>After my <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/\">post on Computer Science</a> this week, I thought I’d share 2 CS-y links I came across this week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401\">How to think in graphs: an illustrative introduction to Graph Theory and its applications | Vardan Grigoryan</a> -  This is a nice “plain language” explanation of basic graph theory.  It’s a bit long, but it’s a nice thing to look at for the folks who told me this week they want to know more about data structures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BL3YHo\">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns | Addy Osmani</a> - One of the better “CS for front end” resources I’m aware of is Addy Osmani’s book on JavaScript design patterns.  Like a lot of things in JS land, parts of it haven’t aged well now that it’s a 6 year old book (it’s very focused on jQuery and DOM manipulation in many of its examples), but since it’s centered around more timeless design patterns, I think it holds up well.</p>",

            "html_content": "<p>I am primarily a front end web developer, and I have a Computer Science degree.  In my experience, this is neither rare nor particularly common.  Folks seem to get into front end dev because they’re trying to solve particular problems, and those problems exist whether you have a PhD in high performance computing or you’ve never written a line of code before.  Front end web development is how you make code real to people, and it is the minimal requirement for making something that people can actually interact with in a web browser.  As a result, a dizzying array of folks get into Front end dev, and you’ll find a broader set of experience levels than devs who work further “down the stack”.  All of which means that many front end devs have never had any sort of “formal” Computer Science education.  </p>\n<p>Some CS degree holders turn up their nose at this, and it contributes to the reputation in some quarters of JavaScript and web dev not being “real programming”.  Some self-taught devs see themselves as being liberated from the “irrelevant theory” of formal Computer Science and see no need for that type of background for Front End development.  We all have the capacity to turn any sort of credential into a tribal mark.  My own experience is that developers can function just fine on the front end without a formal computer science background, but that my own education has helped me in my day to day work, mostly in subtle and indirect ways.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking for a while about what Computer Science topics are actually useful for front end developers.  It’s not obvious to me where to draw the lines, because you’ll never directly encounter many of the concepts that are covered in a typical Computer Science curriculum while making web applications. But I still have an intuition that my background in these subjects is helping me in my day to day.  This weekend I decided to ask Twitter about it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pondering what a blog series on “Computer Science for Front End Devs” would look like.  <br><br>Thinking this would be a high level of “what you missed if you don’t have a CS degree”, focusing on a subset relevant to FE devs.<br><br>Would love input.  What would you expect to be covered?</p>&mdash; Ben McCormick (@ben336) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336/status/965373638697463809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 18, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<p>I got a high degree of interest from that tweet, and so decided to keep digging into the idea.  I did some research into the typical structure of a modern Computer Science curriculum, and came up with the lists below. Depending on the school, certain topics may be elevated or diminished, grouped or split, but the general shape tends to look the same for most schools I’ve looked at.</p>\n<h3>Intro class</h3>\n<p>Generally there is an intro class or 2 that can be skipped by students with previous experience that covers core programming concepts, usually with an Object-oriented philosophical tilt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Programming basics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variables</li>\n<li>Basic Data Structures</li>\n<li>Control Structures/Recursion/Iteration</li>\n<li>Object Oriented Programming principles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Core Curriculum</h3>\n<p>There are also often 3-5 other “core” classes that all CS majors must take.  They generally break down something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big O analysis</li>\n<li>Common Data Structures - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues Trees, Heaps, Graphs, etc</li>\n<li>Common Algorithms - Searches, Sorts, Graph algorithms, etc</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Computer Systems</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start at the hardware level</li>\n<li>Assembly</li>\n<li>Compilers</li>\n<li>Memory Models</li>\n<li>Concurrency</li>\n<li>Operating Systems</li>\n<li>Processes</li>\n<li>File Systems</li>\n<li>Networking</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mathematical Foundations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proofs and logic</li>\n<li>Formal lanugages/Context Free Grammars/Turing Machines</li>\n<li>NP-Completeness</li>\n<li>Probability Theory</li>\n<li>Bayes Theorem</li>\n<li>Hashing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Software Engineering (not always core)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture of larger programs</li>\n<li>Balancing risk/quality/cost</li>\n<li>Design Patterns</li>\n<li>Designing for security/robustness/scalability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Potential Specialties</h3>\n<p>Finally, programs usually have a selection of electives that students can take to dive deeper into different specialty areas.  These electives usually mirror the research interests of the faculty of the school but may include some of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systems Design</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Computer Networking</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Databases</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Computer Science for the web</h2>\n<p>So how much of this is relevant to your average front end developer?  Some of it is more tightly tied to web programming than others.  Most of the basics will be picked up through osmosis for a typical front end dev, but a rigorous look at concepts like object-oriented programming and recursion might be beneficial.  While most can usually get by with simple data structures, a background in common “intermediate” data structures like stacks, trees, and graphs can be quite useful in day to day web dev.  Software Engineering principles are as obviously useful when building web sites as they are when you’re building firmware or operating systems. On the other hand, Computer Systems and Mathematical foundation concepts are usually not directly applicable in front end work.  In my own experience, they serve as useful background for understanding the abstractions that my day to day work is built on.  It’s good to have an intuition as to how browsers work, what is happening when we send data to a file, or what “text encoding” means.  And you may end up in a crazy situation where you need to understand the code behind Babel or V8, and knowledge of compilers becomes a real part of your job.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to figure out the best way to teach some of this stuff to somebody who hasn’t and is never going to spend 4 years taking these classes.  So I’d love help from anyone reading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If you have a CS degree and write front end code, how has it helped you?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you were going to try and share part of that education with somebody with different experiences, which parts would you say are important?  What resources would you recommend?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you don’t have a CS degree, do you feel like you’re missing out on anything?  What useful-seeming concepts have you heard about but found it hard to find resources on?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have any answers for those questions I’d love to hear from y’all on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"mailto:ben@benmccormick.org\">email</a>.  </p>",
