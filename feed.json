            "html_content": "<p>As I’ve gone through projects over time, I’ve found a few functions that I end up creating for every significant project that I’ve worked on.  Some of the details differ from project to project, but the basic function remains the same.  I thought it would be helpful to do a rundown:</p>\n<h3>React/JSX</h3>\n<p>Some of my utils are focused on making JSX nicer to deal with.  2 situations that I’ve run into a lot in JSX are conditionally showing an item in JSX, and determining which of several classes to add to an element based on logic.  Scenarios like these:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>shouldShowCreateButton <span class=\"token operator\">?</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Button\n            onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>createWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'primary'</span>\n            size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Large'</span>\n            disabled <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">'create-button'</span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n            Create Widget\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>Button<span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> classNames <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'create-button'</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>extraClass<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    classNames <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token string\">' '</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> extraClass<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    classNames <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token string\">' is-disabled'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>hasCreateError<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    classNames <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token string\">' has-error'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Button\n        onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>createWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'primary'</span>\n        size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Large'</span>\n        disabled <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>classNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        Create Widget\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>Button<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>These are both ok, and you’ll see plenty of examples of code like them out there, but the first puts a big chunk of code in a ternary, and it’s not always going to be clear to a reader where that <code class=\"language-text\">: null</code> came from at the end, or why it’s there by the time they reach the end.</p>\n<p>In the second example, we’re dealing with a lot of ugly string concatenation.  There are other ways to handle this, like using template strings + ternaries but generally they each provide their own messy pieces.</p>\n<p>To solve these situations, I like to define these 2 small functions:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> isString <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'lodash-es/isString'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> filter <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'lodash-es/filter'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// A helper for React Components to reduce ternary use</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">showIf</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>condition<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> element<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>condition <span class=\"token operator\">?</span> element <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// A helper for handling class lists where some values may be undefined</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// filters out anything that isn't a string and then adds spaces</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">classes</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> classList <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">filter</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>classList<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> c <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">isString</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>c<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> c<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">join</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">' '</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The first just formalizes the most common use of ternaries in JSX (conditionally showing an item) and adds an easy to understand name to it.</p>\n<p>The second lets us work with an array of classNames instead of handling string concat ourselves, and will automatically filter out undefined or empty classNames.  This implementation does silently swallow errors on anything that is not a string, which may not be your preference.  Usage looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token function\">showIf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>shouldShowCreateButton<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Button\n            onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>createWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'primary'</span>\n            size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Large'</span>\n            disabled <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">'create-button'</span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n            Create Widget\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>Button<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>the showIf reads much more clearly than the previous ternary, especially for language newbies who might not be used to ternaries.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> classNames <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'create-button'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> extraClass<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    classNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'is-disabled'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>hasCreateError<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    classNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'has-error'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Button\n        onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>createWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'primary'</span>\n        size <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Large'</span>\n        disabled <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>createEnabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token function\">classes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>classNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        Create Widget\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>Button<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Here we’ve gotten rid of the extra string code and are working on arrays, which is a nicer data structure for dealing with lists of stuff. Also since we’re auto-filtering falsy stuff, we don’t have to worry about whether extraClass was defined if it was passed as a prop to our component or something.</p>\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n<p>So the next few may be different for everyone.  The details here aren’t important, the important thing is that you centralize your formatting of numbers and dates.  For instance, here are functions for formatting dates, normal numbers and percentages from a current project:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> format <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span

punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The first one will take a date object and format it to something like <code class=\"language-text\">05/30/17 01:16 PM</code>.  The second will take a number and return a string formatted with appropriate commas: <code class=\"language-text\">1234567 -&gt; &#39;1,234,567&#39;</code>.  The last one will convert a decimal to a percentage string: <code class=\"language-text\">0.5 -&gt; &#39;50%&#39;</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that none of these functions are very long.  I’m relying on a date library for the first piece and <code class=\"language-text\">toLocaleString</code> for the other 2.  So I could inline this in most places and not have it get much longer.  The benefit of these types of functions is not in saving typing.  It’s in standardizing how you format or don’t format things throughout an application.  This has 2 benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s easy to fix bugs, add features or switch between libraries for these common tasks across your application because all of the logic is centralized.  If I needed to start supporting more locales than just the US for percentage formatting, or use moment for my date formatting library I could easily do so with edits to only one file.  That file is also well unit tested, so those transitions would be safe.</li>\n<li>It lets us control which formats are allowed.  For instance we’re allowing the function caller to specify how many decimal points to show for the numeric functions, but not giving options to change the date format for the formatting function, because we want that to be the same everywhere.  If we need to support multiple formats for different scenarios, like a date-only format or a format for communicating with the API, we can add options for that which don’t open up all formats, or expose them as separate functions.  With dates in particular, I want imports of libraries like moment or date-fns to be limited to 2 or 3 files at the most, and not used ad-hoc throughout the codebase.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that all my examples so far have utilized other utility libraries like lodash and date-fns.  The best utility functions are those that you don’t have to maintain yourself.  I do recommend looking for libraries that you can tree-shake and only take what you need though.  Other ones like moment.js can make a big difference on your JavaScript bundle size if you let them.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>Timeout functions are useful, but the browsers built in functions are callback based and don’t play well with promises or async await.  We can fix that:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">sleep</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> secs <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Promise</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>res <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>res<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> secs <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">1000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">pause</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">sleep</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I now have a promisified version of setTimeout (<code class=\"language-text\">sleep</code>) and a special case version with a 0 timeout (useful for things that should happen as soon as possible after the current event loop executes. I prefer dealing with things in seconds over milliseconds, so I changed the API to use that.  That is probably not everyone’s cup of tea, so feel free to copy and modify.</p>\n<p>Usage looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// function to kick off a \"job\" of some type and then</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// check every 30 seconds to see if the job is complete</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> createJobAndShowResults <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">createJob</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// don't do this without a timeout/failure</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// condition in real life!</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">while</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"token function\">sleep</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">30</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> jobStatus <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">checkIfJobIsCompleted</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>jobStatus<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>complete<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> jobStatus<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h3>And Even More!</h3>\n<p>This is just a sample of the small functions I usually create in projects.  Pretty much all of them exist for one or more of the reasons that were already discussed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smoothing over awkward library syntax like multiple classes in JSX or HTML templates</li>\n<li>Making user intention clear with a well named function, like showIf or stdDateFormat</li>\n<li>Ensuring consistent application-specific behavior across common low-level operations like formatting or logging</li>\n<li>Making it easy to replace 3rd party utility libraries  like date-fns by wrapping them in an application specific function</li>\n<li>Improving browser level APIs, or shaping them to have useful defaults for the current application, like we did with toLocaleString and setTimeout.</li>\n</ol>",

She’s an assistant professor who teaches writing to college students, and has found that her students pursuing technical degrees generally fail to see the value in learning to write.  The contrast between their expectations and my perspective after a decade working in software was strong.  I promised her at the time that I’d write down some thoughts on why writing skills are valuable for software engineers.  So here it is, 6 reasons that writing skills are crucial for working in the tech industry<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h4>1. You will write every day</h4>\n<p>Every industry has truths that are obvious to those who have spent time working in the industry, but may be surprising to those on the outside.  One such truth for software engineers: our jobs involve an awful lot of writing.  Here are a few types of writing that I’ve done daily or weekly for the last decade:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussing technical implementations through chat apps like slack</li>\n<li>Writing Bug Reports</li>\n<li>Writing comments in my code and technical documentation to help others and my future self understand what was done</li>\n<li>Writing reviews of other developers code to help our team improve and coordinate on best practices</li>\n<li>Answering questions from less technical employees or clients, often through email or slack.</li>\n<li>Creating design documents for complex work during planning times</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That list is illustrative but not exhaustive.  Any software engineer who wishes to build software that is used by others will end up doing plenty of writing.</p>\n<h4>2. The ability to explain complex topics will set you apart</h4>\n<p>The ability to take a complex topic and explain it in terms that somebody who doesn’t have all the background you do can understand is a critical one for software engineers.  This can help negate two of the most frustrating experiences for a developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A business asking for work that doesn’t make sense because the business folks don’t understand how the product works</li>\n<li>Less experienced members of the the team routinely making mistakes and breaking things because they don’t understand how the product works</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Senior engineers who can explain and document complex pieces of software save everyone frustration by helping junior members of the team understand how things work and be more productive, and by aligning business expectations and plans to the reality of how their software systems actually work.  These are hugely valuable activities that can make a big difference in your career.</p>\n<h4>3. Writing will help you find a (better) job</h4>\n<p>When I’ve interviewed software engineers, I see a variety of problems: they fail to present their strengths, don’t manage to show a sincere interest in the job, and get caught flat-footed on fairly standard questions.  Most of these mistakes come down to a lack of preparation, not tailoring their message to their audience, and not knowing how to structure the information they know about themselves in a compelling way.  These are the skills that you’ll learn from a good class on writing, and develop through practice writing.</p>\n<p>Interviews are important, especially early on in your career.  Your compensation as you go throughout your career tends to be anchored to where you started, especially if you stay one place for a long time.  An increase of $5,000 in salary on a job you take today would mean an additional $92,000 of accumulated income over the next 15 years assuming a salary increase rate of 3% a year<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition if you write publicly on a blog like this, it can help you show proof of your knowledge in a way that a resume never will.  Not everybody needs to be publicly blogging, but if that appeals to you it can be a great career booster.</p>\n<h4>4. Remote work increases the importance of writing</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest trends in the tech industry these days is the <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/blog/remote-workforce-rise/\">rise of remote work</a>. More teams are embracing partial remote work, and there are major companies like Buffer, Invision and GitLab that are entirely remote.  Remote work is partially enabled by video chat technology, but written communication is the lifeblood of a successful remote team. Collaborating via tools like Slack, Github, Trello and Jira is part of most teams’ workflows, but when everybody is remote, being able to express yourself clearly on these platforms is critical.</p>\n<h4>5. Your career trajectory will depend on your ability to influence and persuade</h4>\n<p>Most developers when they begin their first software job will be given a set of tasks to do and the expectation is that they will create work to the spec that somebody else has designed.  They are implementors.  But as a developers career progresses there is an opportunity to be more than an implementor.  Since developers understand the system best, they often have ideas that can help shape product designs.  Developers also often need to work with other teams whose goals may not be completely aligned with their team.  These are not situations where even a senior engineer is likely to have direct authority.  Instead the developers who continue to grow in their careers are those who are able to influence and persuade without authority.</p>\n<p>This is again a skill that writing classes can cultivate.  Persuasive writing practice can help give you the clarity of thought and intuition for structuring arguments that will help both when you’re trying to make a point through writing or doing it verbally.</p>\n<h4>6. Writing skills translate to writing code</h4>\n<p>This last one is really specific to software engineering, but I’ve found that applying writing principles to code has helped me write more maintainable code.  Most code written in a professional context will be read many times by other people (or by the original author after they have long lost track of their original context).  Being able to write code that can be understood by both a computer and by human beings is a skill developed over time, but many of the same “brain muscles” that you develop in writing prose can be applied to code: it’s important to know your audience, structure your information in a logical manner, and use judgement when finding just the right phrase (or code structure) for a situation.  That could be a whole post in itself.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I write based on the tech industry and software development specifically because that is what I have lived, but most of these points should be equally applicable to any engineering career and would likely require very little modification for science and research as well.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Ok real world promotion rates in the tech industry are likely to be choppier than that, but the example holds.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

            "html_content": "<p><em>A member of my team at work asked me last week how I continue to learn things about JavaScript.  This is my answer. Note that it is focused on leveling up for folks with existing programming experience, not giving the best pathway into the field.</em></p>\n<p>I’m going to break this up into 3 parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The different ways people tackle learning new programming things</li>\n<li>An inventory of the different types of resources out there for learning programming</li>\n<li>My specific recommendations for JavaScript and React resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first 3 are going to be generalizable to any type of learning about programming you want to pursue (and probably other fields as well).  The last one is necessarily more specific.</p>\n<h4>Learning Strategies</h4>\n<p>It’s helpful to start by talking about the different ways that people learn programming concepts.  We can break things up into 3 categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practical</strong>:  This is where you work on projects and pursue goals, and learn the things you need as you need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Topical</strong>: This is when you commit to learning something about a certain set of topics that you think will be valuable.  This may be related to work you’re doing, but your goal is a deep understanding of the topic moreso than trying to solve a specific problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Serendipitous</strong>: This type of learning isn’t directed at all.  You’re just diving into learning as you encounter new terms or concepts, trying to absorb and understand everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So which one is best?  You’ll hear arguments for all three, but personally I see learning like investing; it’s a long term game that you can’t win in a day, the gains accumulate slowly until suddenly you’re a long way from where you started, and one of the keys is diversifying.</p>\n<p>Practical knowledge is safe; when you focus on learning things you need, you’ll rarely waste your time, will likely get more done, and will put yourself in a position to learn more interesting things as you develop a reputation for doing good work.  However focusing solely on learning the things you need to do your current job may blind you to trends and eventually leave you with an out of date skill set. In addition, while you may be looking for answers to practical problems, if your knowledge base is narrow to start you may miss out on innovative ideas because you don’t have exposure to solutions that might not “google well” for the way you think of your current needs.</p>\n<p>Topical knowledge can be very useful when jumping into a new area of work: sometimes you just need a level of exposure to the syntax, concepts and tools behind a language, framework or project before you can effectively work with it.  But learning about a topic divorced from a project can sometimes feel more productive in the moment than it actually ends up being: without practical experience of the pain points that the topic is solving for and/or causing, it can be hard to know what is important and make the connections that you really need. Topical learning can also devolve into a purely academic exercise where you never really learn to apply what you know.</p>\n<p>Serendipitous learning on the face of it is the most easily wasted; trying to learn everything can be overwhelming in programming, a field based on layers of abstractions, with a plethora of different subfields that can be explored for years without learning everything. However sometimes it is the dash of inspiration that comes from bringing previously disconnected ideas together that leads to the creation of something novel and great.  And those types of connection only come from somebody who is learning broadly as well as deeply.  Being curious also prevents the pitfalls of purely practical learning: dead-ends and blind spots. So there is a place for serendipitous learning too.</p>\n<p>The best approach is a mix of the 3: have real problems that you’re trying to solve, but make sure to keep an eye out for interesting things, and don’t be afraid of the occasional deep dive into a useful sounding topic.</p>\n<h3>Resource Types</h3>\n<p>There are so many ways to learn things in the programming world.  Below is a brief roundup of resource types, ordered roughly in terms of stability and how rapidly they produce new material.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Courses</strong> - College, bootcamps, Coursera, etc:  These are the ultimate in topical learning.  Not something that most people are doing every day, but can be great for rebooting a career if you want to head in a new direction or refresh after being away from the field for a while.</li>\n<li><strong>Books</strong> - People are still writing programming books.  These tend to fall into 2 categories: books about a specific framework or technique and more “timeless” books about some fundamental part of how we write software. The first group tends. to age fast but can be great for topical learning, the second are an essential resource for “higher level” thinking about our field.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Courses</strong> - In recent years, video courses seem to have grown in popularity as a way of teaching programming.  They’ve never been my cup of tea, but they can be great topical guides to new subjects for visual learners who don’t want to commit to a full academic course.</li>\n<li><strong>Wikis</strong> - There are several places online where developers aggregate documentation in an open way.  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> are the most prominent.  These can be an excellent authoritative source to start looking for answers that still are able to remain relevant as best practices and trends change.</li>\n<li><strong>Blogs</strong> -  Blogs come in a variety of flavors.  They can be focused profitable publishing platforms with multiple authors like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> or occasionally updates on a variety of topics from an individual developer.  They tend to be the best source for in depth “how tos” on niche topics that might not justify a book or be fully covered by a wiki.</li>\n<li><strong>Podcasts</strong> - There are lots of developer podcasts out there.  Due to the audio nature of the medium, they tend to be more focused on high level ideas and less likely to drift into the nitty gritty of code.</li>\n<li><strong>Newsletters</strong> - Newsletters like this one can be a great way to get regular updates from knowledgeable developers or receive aggregations of interesting links. I’ve personally found them more and more valuable in recent years as a way of bringing the best content to the surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Github/Looking at code</strong> - Sometimes the best way to learn is to go straight to the source.  We live in a golden age of open source software, where billions of lines of code are available for anyone to look at online.  Code is ultimately the source of truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Forums, Mailing Lists &#x26; Chat Groups</strong> - Many technologies, geographic areas and interest groups have vibrant online communities that can be a great source of learning.  In the past these groups tended to exist as mailing groups, IRC channels or forum sites.  But nowadays the most popular form of community seems to be chat groups implemented with Slack or Discord.</li>\n<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - These aren’t something that most of us can do regularly, but conferences are a great place to be introduced to new ideas and make connections with people in a tech community.</li>\n<li><strong>Meetup Groups</strong> - A more accessible option than conferences for many people, most mid-sized and larger cities have multiple tech meetup groups that can be a good place to grow a tech community and be introduced to new concepts</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregators</strong> - Aggregator sites like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> are useful places to encounter new ideas.  Compared to the options above, they’re much noisier; you’ll encounter a mix of content quality and topics.  But it can be a great way to find serendipitous ideas and find new blogs, podcasts and communities to follow.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - Social Media sites (especially Twitter) can be a great way to get a sense of whats on a tech communities collective mind, and encounter concepts and ideas while they’re still being formed.  But it also can be a distracting mess of noise.  So consider moderating your intake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d generally recommend a mix of the resources above, though you’ll find some are more helpful to you than others I personally have found that books, blogs, newsletters, wikis and aggregators have been the most useful for me personally, as well as finding ways to teach others through meetup groups, conferences and my own blog.  There is real truth in the idea that the best way to learn something well is to teach it.</p>\n<h3>Specific Resources</h3>\n<p>So the above stuff is all pretty generic.  I’ll end by listing some resources that I’ve found personally helpful in learning and keeping up with the JavaScript and React world.  This isn’t exhaustive, and I know there are a lot of great resources out there that I haven’t personally used.  But this is my list:</p>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix\">JavaScript Allongé</a> is a great ebook about functional JavaScript.  It was very influential for me in terms of how I structure my code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TTXlZt\">Effective JavaScript</a> is a bit dated now; it was written pre-ES6.  But it’s the best non-beginner book I’ve read about the JavaScript language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GNviXY\">Clean Architecture</a> is my favorite book on Software Architecture.  If you want to think about how we structure programs at a higher level, it is worth a read</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GPi6ll\">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> is a book I’ve mentioned a few times recently here; Its my new recommendation for a first “writing better code” book because its so concise.  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TRAPAl\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> played that role for me personally though, and I’d still recommend it as well for any developer who hasn’t read it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Atomic Design</a> is a great book on building modern design systems, and has been useful for me as I think about how to break down UIs in my development work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Video Courses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/\">Egghead.io</a> is the best source for dev video content I’ve found.  Video has never really been my jam, I prefer text content where I can go through it at my pace and easily reference back and forth between it and code.  But it can be great to get a focused intro to a topic, and Egghead seems to have nailed the format with its collection of short focused snippets. It’s mostly a paid service, but there is a bunch of great free content on there, especially beginner React stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Wikis</h4>\n<p>These are maybe stupid obvious, but I’ve learned more from these 3 sites than probably anything else listed here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> is the single best source for software development information on the internet.  Note that I would advise most people to use it as more of a googleable resource than a place to ask questions; they’re focused on documenting canonical answers to common problems moreso than chasing down situational issues, and for popular technologies they are fairly comprehensive.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN</a> is my site of choice for learning about browser APIs and JavaScript/CSS/HTML language features.  It’s extremely reliable, and generally very readable (although some articles are much more detailed than others).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> is a surprisingly great place to learn about general computer science concepts.  I wouldn’t use it for front end specific stuff, there are better resources there, but if I want to learn about a classical computer science concept like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue\">priority queue</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a> wikipedia usually has a pretty robust article giving the basic background.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Blogs</h4>\n<p>For blogs, I highly recommend getting a good RSS reader so you can keep up with posts as they come.  My tool of choice here is <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/\">Feedbin</a> for which I pay a very small monthly fee, but there are good free alternatives like <a href=\"/https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://2ality.com/\">2ality</a> is a blog focused on new JavaScript features as they work their way through the TC39 development process.  It’s the best resource I know of for understanding what is coming down the language pipeline, and also learning about new features when they are released.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">Overreacted</a> is Dan Abramov’s “Advanced React” blog.  It’s the best single source of knowledge on React that I’ve seen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> is more of a mega-blog, with multiple articles published a day by a variety of authors.  It’s consistently high quality content, and even though it leans more towards “web site development” than “web app development” there is stuff here that anyone will find interesting.  It’s also been around a long time and has great historical resources for learning newish CSS standards like CSS Grid and Flexbox.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/\">The official React Blog</a> is excellent and a great place to get “official news” about React.  The same applies for other frameworks like Ember, Vue, and Angular; you always want to be following the official source and not just getting your news from the community.  It greatly reduces the chances of misunderstanding and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming\">cargo culting</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org\">benmccormick.org</a>.  Ok I’m sort of kidding here, but the truth is that having my own blog has been one of the best ways for me to learn; I learn when I write, I can reference back to older posts when I’m re-engaging with a topic, and things stick better when you write them down.  Plus when I write posts like this where I’m linking other resources, its easier for me to find those resources later. (but uh… feel free to tell everyone to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/subscribe\">subscribe</a> to my blog anyway)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Newsletter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a> is a great “list of links” style newsletter every week.  If you just want a pulse of the weekly news in the JS community, I think this is the best place to find it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/subscribe/\">Kent C Dodds’ Newsletter</a> is a great resource for React and JavaScript testing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">Hacker Newsletter</a> is a roundup of the top <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> posts each week.  Hacker News can be a bit of a mess (the comments are often written from deep within the startup bubble and the quality of links at any given time on the site is mixed) but it’s an amazing source of interesting content if you’re willing to wade through it.  This newsletter lets somebody else do that for you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://this-week-in-react.org/\">This week in React</a> is another source of advanced React content.  It’s actually just a summary of the interesting things going on in the React repo itself.  So if you’re interested in contributing to React or want to see how they’re progressing against their roadmap, it’s an interesting and quick read each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Aggregators &#x26; Social Media</h4>\n<p>Honestly, 2 years ago I probably would have led with this section; Twitter and Hacker News were a huge part of how I have found interesting content and built my skills over the past 5 years.  But I’ve gotten disenchanted with them over time as they became part of a broader issue of my increasing inability to focus on things because of the abundance of technology related distractions in my life.  So… caveat emptor.  That said here are some people I’d recommend following on Twitter if you’re interested in React and JavaScript.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>React</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\">Kent C Dodds</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\">Ryan Florence</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acemarke\">Mark Erikson</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">Shawn Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rauchg\">Guillermo Rauch</a></li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyleet\">Tracy Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_developit\">Jason Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slicknet\">Nicholas Zakas</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A final note</h3>\n<p>I just want to end where I started, and encourage you to not rush out and try to absorb all of these things at once, but instead work on projects and find the resources that give you what you need.  And then explore a bit on the side to help yourself grow.  Your resources will probably be different than mine.  The internet is huge, the world is even bigger. Explore and have fun!</p>",

            "html_content": "<p>I recently read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Elk5g8\">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout.  In an early chapter he paints a picture of a “tactical tornado” programmer, a programmer who is always focused on solving the current problem by the most expedient method possible, with no thought to the long term implications.  I suspect anyone with even a few years in the programming has seen programmers like this, and has also from time to time written “tactical” code like this themselves.  Ousterhout’s recommendation is instead to write code strategically rather than tactically, taking more up front time to plan the structure for the benefit of longer term productivity.</p>\n<p>Ousterhout focuses his examination of tactical vs strategic coding on the issue of complexity.  Complexity as he defines it is anything that makes the system difficult to work with.  It is the root issue behind much of the <em>ease of change</em> concern I identified in my <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/\">recent post</a>.  But we can expand this to encompass all of the front end concerns.  We can easily impact reliability, performance, ease of change, accessibility, security and capability when we make short hand tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>Let’s consider the problem of getting a new sign up page set up for a site.  There are several different approaches we could take.  By far the simplest is a basic HTML page using normal CSS and little or no JavaScript, that posts to a backend service after the signup and then redirects to a different static page.  We could set this up on S3 or any other service that will host static files.  On the other extreme, we could set up a new server side rendered Typescript-based React application that uses Next.js to give us server side rendering, which we deploy using Docker and a fully automated CI build system with chatbot ops.  Which one of these approaches is better?</p>\n<p>A tactical tornado would likely prefer the first solution.  They could get the whole thing up and running in an hour, stamp it and call it done.  Other developers might be attracted to the <em>cool</em> approach and want to avoid the “outdated” approach.  But we can only really answer the question by stepping back and asking some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the future of this application?  Is this a standalone page, or the first page in a larger application?</li>\n<li>What feature requests are we likely to get for the page?  Is it probable that we’ll eventually need form validation, dynamic success and failure states, complex behavior that depends on the use case?</li>\n<li>What browsers are we supporting</li>\n<li>What are our performance benchmarks?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions like that can tell us when we’ll benefit from an up front investment in certain areas, and when it’s wiser to be quick and dirty.  They also allow us to evaluate whether any options we’re considering might cut us off from achieving long term goals.  For instance, if we know that we’ll eventually need to scale this site into a large application with responsive interactions, personalized content and information maintained between page loads, building this out as a series of static pages which POST to a backend would eventually limit our capabilities or require a refactor.  But if this is only a one-off landing page for an event happening next week that won’t be maintained beyond that point, developing a long-term maintenance strategy would be wasted effort.  This is <em>strategic coding</em>, and it doesn’t stop at the beginning of a project, it’s an ongoing mindset that you can take as you add each new feature to an application.</p>\n<p>Ousterhout makes a case that aligns with my experience, that strategic programming is a long term winner.  I’ve seen that over time improvements to ease of change will often help a team save time lost, significant hits to performance, security, reliability may hurt them more than a fast solution saves them, and solutions that unreasonably limit us in terms of system capability or accessibility will ultimately get rejected.  The weasel words there exist for a reason… sometimes it really is the best idea to just get something working.  But a strategic programmer will understand the context of their project, and make wise choices about where and how to invest in the codebase.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It is possible to program either tactically or strategically</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tactical programming is focused on solving the immediate problem as quickly as possible</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Strategic coding considers the context of the problem, and any architectural concerns involved in a change</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Strategic coding doesn’t mean never hacking and always investing, it means letting context inform the amount and direction of investment in a codebase</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>PS: I put a <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/12/31/book-review-philosophy-of-software-design/\">full review of A Philosophy of Software Design</a> up on the site a few weeks ago.

            "html_content": "<p>Once you get past the initial complexity it creates by bucking conventions, React is the most developer friendly UI library I have ever used.  A big reason for that is the way it uses and encourages a variety of patterns to share codes and concepts across a code base. Let’s look at how 4 traditional code re-use patterns are used by React and in the React ecosystem, using a simple counter example to explore why each pattern is used.</p>\n<h4>Inheritance</h4>\n<p>Inheritance is a code-reuse technique associated with object oriented programming.  If you’re like me and learned to program in school using Java, it probably is one of the very first Computer Science concepts you learned.  For self-taught JavaScript devs it may be much less familiar.  Inheritance is a pattern for extending an existing class or object with additional methods or data, possibly overriding the implementations of other methods in the process.  A classic example of inheritance looks like this in JS:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code

behavior across similar but slightly different objects and you want to be able to treat all of the objects as interchangeable from an API perspective. This is especially valuable when that interchangeable API is well defined and unlikely to change too much.  However it tends to lead to brittle structures when nested across multiple levels, and is a poor fit when dealing with dissimilar objects that need to share a few behaviors.</p>\n<p>React Components are objects that we want to treat as interchangeable from an outside API perspective, and they have well defined points where behavior may need to be different between components but don’t always need to differ: the lifecycle methods like render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, etc.  Thus React relies on a single level of inheritance as the foundation of its class components.  Class components inherit from React.Component, and only implement the life cycle methods that they’re interested in.  But all of them inherit useable setState and forceUpdate functions, and React can verify that by checking the <code class=\"language-text\">isReactComponent</code> property on the object.</p>\n<p>Here is a basic counter component.  Notice how we don’t have to define <code class=\"language-text\">setState</code> on our <code class=\"language-text\">Counter</code> class.  Instead it inherits it from React.Component.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">//counter.js</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Counter</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Component</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>props<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>props<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>state <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            count<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>state<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">increment</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">setState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>state <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n               count<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> state<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>count <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n            <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"fancy-layout\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"fancy-display\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n                Current Count<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>button\n                className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"incrementCounterBtn fancy-btn\"</span>\n                onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">></span>Increment<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>button<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Outside of this single layer of inheritance for defining Class components, inheritance isn’t used much in React development.

components, and it takes thing to the next level by allowing components to be stateful and pass values down into children.  For instance, if we wanted to split the counter component above into a separate control and display, perhaps using a standard set of UI components we could do it by extracting <code class=\"language-text\">FancyLayout</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">FancyButton</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">FancyDisplay</code> elements out into their own components and then composing them back into a single counter component.

Three of them are laser-focused on defining a specific element type, and are “display only” with no logic of their own.  The 4th contains all of our logic and defines how the display pieces come together.</p>\n<p>In the seminal 1994 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WDhncv\">Design Patterns</a> the authors argue that composition should be strictly preferred over inheritance where possible because it creates less tightly coupled objects, and encourages designs where objects are small, focused and readable.  Composition also lets us hide complexity inside of child objects, because parent components only have to concern themselves with the APIs exposed by those child objects.  One of the keys to React’s success has been making this type of composition clean and painless by encouraging strong component interfaces and utilizing JSX to provide a comfortable syntax for describing composed UIs while keeping all component concerns in the same place<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that after this refactor, our counting logic is still tightly tied to the layout of our counter component.  Let’s explore 2 more patterns that can help us extract our logic from the display completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Composition Pattern</strong>: The core pattern for separating concerns while creating complex UIs with React.</p>\n<h4>Decorators</h4>\n<p>Decorators are a pattern for editing an instance of a class to give it additional behaviors than it had previously.  In contrast to inheritance, decorators are not part of the class definition, but are modifications to the class at run time to allow a subset of objects to have additional data or behavior <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  In classic object oriented programming, this was implemented by having a decorator class that shared an interface with the class to be decorated, and called its methods through to that class, with additional behavior before or after the pass-through.  The React community has generally implemented this pattern slightly differently, by writing functions that take a component class and return a new component class that calls through to the original component, possibly with additional props passed in, extra components rendered around it, or conditional logic that causes it not to render in some cases.  The React community generally refers to this pattern as <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\">Higher Order Components</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of using a higher order component called <code class=\"language-text\">withCounter</code> to separate out the display and logic portions of our Counter component.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\"

pieces.  The display logic remains in a simplified <code class=\"language-text\">CounterDisplay</code> component that doesn’t have any state or business logic of its own.  <code class=\"language-text\">CounterDisplay</code> takes 2 new props, <code class=\"language-text\">count</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">increment</code> that allow it to implement the counting logic without having to know how it is implemented.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we split the counting logic out into a Higher Order Component.  <code class=\"language-text\">withCounter</code> takes a React component and wraps it with another component that is solely responsible for keeping track of counts and providing the increment function.  In this case that is our CounterDisplay component, but if we decided we wanted to also have fancy counters that incremented when the user clicked a checkbox or hovered over a box or typed the word increment, it would be easy to reuse this logic.</p>\n<p>Higher Order Components helped many React libraries like Redux and React Router define elegant APIs when they first came on the scene, but they’ve always been a power user technique.  There are many ways to screw them up, and although they allow for theoretical loose coupling, they still require a certain level of shared understanding between the decorator and decoratee, including knowing what props to make available, whether any methods have to be proxied through to the decorated component, and more.  The community as a whole has tended to favor render props over the past year<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>, and now looks poised to move towards our 4th pattern: mixins.</p>\n<p><strong>Decorator Pattern</strong>: Used to provide a nice interface for separating out logic shared by multiple components and centralizing it.</p>\n<h4>Mixins</h4>\n<p>The newest pattern that React has added to its bag of code reuse tricks is also one of the oldest.  In older versions of React there was a feature called “mixins” that was <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html\">later deprecated due to its ease of mis-use</a>.  “Mixins” are gone now, but the “Mixin pattern” is back!  React is in the process of introducing <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">hooks</a>, a new way of doing mixins.</p>\n<p>So first, what is a mixin?  It is yet another way of defining shared behavior onto a class, in this case providing methods and/or data that are “mixed in” to one or more classes.  It differs from inheritance because a class using a mixin doesn’t have to use the mixin as a parent class, and the class may use several mixins at once.  Mixins that are used together in one class may not be used together in another.  Mixins also different from the decorator pattern, because the mixin is part of the class definition, not something that is applied dynamically later.</p>\n<p>Mixins are useful when you have classes with different purposes that shouldn’t share an inheritance tree but do have some shared behavior.  In practice though they have historically been tricky to use because it is easy to tightly bind mixin code to the implementation of the code that it is mixed into.  Poorly implemented Mixins can result in naming collisions, inflexible code, and hard to trace errors.</p>\n<p>React Hooks may not look like mixins, since they are used in a function, not a class.  But they fill the exact same role as traditional mixins, while avoiding some of the footguns (no naming collisions!).  Let’s look at an example from Dan Abramov’s blog post <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889\">introducing hooks</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">useWindowWidth</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>width<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> setWidth<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>innerWidth<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">useEffect</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">handleResize</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">setWidth</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>innerWidth<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'resize'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> handleResize<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">removeEventListener</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'resize'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> handleResize<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> width<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is a hook that provides the width of the current window to a React component, updating each time the window is resized.  You would use it in practice like this example of a header bar that replaces its menu items with a hamburger menu on smaller screens:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">Header</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> windowWidth <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useWindowWidth</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> showHamburgerMenu <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> windowWidth <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">800</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Logo<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>showHamburgerMenu <span class=\"token operator\">?</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>HamburgerMenu<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>MenuItems<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This usage is different from a normal helper function, because it enhances the component; because this is using React’s state code within the hook, this component will automatically update when needed.  So it is a way of reusing component behavior like Higher Order Components.  But we lose a lot of the disadvantages of HOCs.   <code class=\"language-text\">useWindowWidth</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Header</code> are extremely loosely coupled.  <code class=\"language-text\">useWindowWidth</code> doesn’t know anything about the header bar structure or logic, or the rules for when things should show.  It is only providing information.  At the same time, if we refactored it to get the window size in some other way, or to throttle updates, we wouldn’t have to change anything about <code class=\"language-text\">Header</code>, since all it knows is that <code class=\"language-text\">useWindowWidth</code> will occasionally provide it an updated windowWidth.</p>\n<p>The functional style makes this look different than a traditional object oriented “mixin pattern” example, but it is using the same concepts and solving the same problems.  This way of doing things has advantages; because it is “just a function” that gets called, we never need to worry about it having a naming collision with a different class method, or having to be aware of the structure of the outer component.  If it needs component specific information, we can just pass it an argument.</p>\n<p>With Hooks, we can create a much cleaner version of our Higher Order Component example from the decorators section.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// defined in a library file</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">useIncrement</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>initial <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n   <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useReducer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>val <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> val <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> initial<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n   <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// counter.js</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">Counter</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useIncrement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>FancyLayout<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>FancyDisplay<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n            Current Count<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>FancyDisplay<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>FancyButton\n            className<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"incrementCounterBtn\"</span>\n            onClick<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"token operator\">></span>Increment<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>FancyButton<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>FancyLayout<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>As with decorators we’ve extracted the logic in a reusable form, but we’ve done so with much less boilerplate.  I’ve removed the intermediate <code class=\"language-text\">CounterDisplay</code> here, because if we’re not using it for anything else, it is easy enough to just include the hook directly in the definition.  But if we wanted, we could easily use that <code class=\"language-text\">CounterDisplay</code> component with a hooks enabled wrapper component:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">Counter</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">useIncrement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>CounterDisplay count<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> increment<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>increment<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><strong>Mixin Pattern</strong>: Hooks use a variation on the Mixin pattern to allow sharing related behavior and data between unrelated function components easily.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>If I took one thing out of this analysis personally, it was a renewed appreciation for considering the needs of a situation and finding the right approach for the job, rather than trying to fit every problem to my favorite solution.

            "html_content": "<p>Performance is a tricky topic to give generalized advice about.  Moreso than any of the other <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/\">front end concerns</a> I discussed in my post at the beginning of the year, it is remarkably tied into the details of what an app is doing and how it is built.  That said, here are some general principles for designing performant applications that I’ve picked up over the years:</p>\n<h4>1. Measure First</h4>\n<p>One of the most tempting things with performance is to start making changes before you have a specific slow measurement to improve.  Maybe you’re writing your code up front with a major focus on performance because you know you’ll need it, or diving in to make changes the first time a user complains about slowness.  Regardless it can be tempting to “performance tune” before you get detailed performance measurements.</p>\n<p>This is problematic for 2 reasons: First, we often don’t know what good enough system performance is until users start using the system.  Secondly, programmers’ data-free intuitions on what parts of a system will be slow tend to be universally awful.</p>\n<p>Measuring different aspects of your system first provides several benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It gives you micro-benchmarks to improve upon, rather than waiting till “it feels good”</li>\n<li>It lets you determine which parts of the system are actually slow, so you can focus on bottlenecks</li>\n<li>It may help you justify performance focused work to project stakeholders.</li>\n<li>It will allow you to test for regressions later on</li>\n<li>It may reveal that the system performance is actually adequate in most situations, and help you narrow down edge cases to optimize or restrict</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that this advice encompasses two often quoted pieces of advice: Donald Knuth’s “Premature optimization is the root of all evil” and Kent Beck’s “Make it work, make it right, make it fast”.  When you only optimize based off of measurements, those things are going to naturally fall into place.</p>\n<p>So what should you measure? On the front end Google’s <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail\">RAIL model</a> is a good place to start.  For loading you can look at benchmarks like first paint, first meaningful paint, and Time To Interactive (TTI) as useful benchmarks. They also provide similar guidance for input responsiveness and animation. Google is a bit preachy about specific perf benchmarks to my mind, but their analysis of <em>what</em> to measure is fantastic.</p>\n<p>It’s also useful to be able to communicate to backend developers when slowness comes from backend requests, so it’s good to familiarize yourself with the network panel in your favorite browser’s developer tools.  That will let you see how long different requests are taking and help evaluate when a performance problem is actually a network problem.</p>\n<h4>2. Assume the network is slow</h4>\n<p>Related to the end of the last point, one of the defining attributes of front end development is that it always involves a network.  You can think of network requests as a giant chaos machine at the heart of your web application.  Network requests will fail, they will be slow… and they’ll almost always look better to you in local development than they will be to your users, assuming like many developers that you’re operating on reasonably good hardware and decent wifi.</p>\n<p>So the network can be a bit of a performance trap for devs.  While I still advocate measuring first, with the network it’s worth assuming that your local setup is not a good proxy for the user and either finding ways to do better tests or simply expecting that the user will have a slower or flakier connection and designing for that.  Firefox and Chrome are very helpful here, as they will allow you to simulate slower connections from within their network panel, allowing you to experience your app the way your users do.  This is especially important if you’re targeting mobile users.</p>\n<h4>3. You can do things more efficiently or you can do less</h4>\n<p>This is ultimately the heart of performance.  When an operation is slow, it is ultimately because your user’s computer is performing too many operations to fit them all into the time you want them to.  To speed things up, you either have to reduce the number of operations by making your code more efficient, or by removing some work completely.  When people talk about compiled languages being faster than non-compiled languages, this is usually what they mean: compilers are very proficient at optimizing code for efficiency and removing wasted operations.</p>\n<p>On the front end there are several major areas of potential waste: we can send too many things over the network, we can cause the browser to repaint or layout thrash unnecessarily, and we can block critical actions like responding to a users input with less critical actions like re-rendering an item offscreen.  Each of those could merit a series of articles on their own, but are great starting points when thinking about how to improve performance when no one component is obviously slow.</p>\n<p>But it is worth remembering that sometime the only way out is doing less. Maybe you need to delay rendering some parts of the screen, or remove an expensive to render visualization. Maybe you should be using built in components instead of shipping a fancy UI component library.  I have no idea what your use case is, but it’s always worth thinking about what you can do less of.</p>\n<h4>4. Perception matters more than reality</h4>\n<p>Engineers like to deal with data and reality.  My first 3 points played right into that.  Now it’s time to go against the grain.  The truth is that users aren’t pulling up devtools to check and see if your site is slow.  It either feels slow to them or it doesn’t.  And the actual numbers are only part of that perception.  Here are some things that can make fast sites seem sluggish and slow sites seem broken:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Not showing a visual response to user interaction</strong></p>\n<p>When a user clicks a button that triggers a network request, and the system does nothing till that request completes, it will lead to the user thinking the system is slow at best and broken at worst.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Freezing the interface while waiting on a response to a previous interaction</strong></p>\n<p>It’s always important to keep the screen interactive while waiting on a request, even if some options are disabled or limited.  The user should be able to access navigation and other standard elements of the interface as normal.  In a scenario where the request is saving data, it may be necessary to add prompts to check whether they want to interrupt the save however.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loading states without any movement or animation</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes people just want to know that you’re doing something.  Animation communicates that something is happening.  It can be a spinner, a flowing placeholder block, or a progress bar.  The important thing is to show the user “things are happening”.  Of course the more relevant your loading state is the better.  Facebook’s placeholder items in their newsfeed create an illusion of content coming in even faster since the loading state itself helps frame the screen for the user.  Much more effective than a loading spinner that serves to remind the user that they’re having to wait for something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Performance Is All About Effort</h3>\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7\">David Gilbertson’s great post on performance</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s really easy to make a slow site, all you have to do is not try to make a fast one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Performance comes down to caring, measuring and investing.  If you set reasonable benchmarks, and track them as you make changes, you’re likely to find ways to achieve them.  If you set unreasonable benchmarks and make the space to work at them, you’re likely to do better than anyone who isn’t trying that hard would expect.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Measure First</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Assume The Network is Slow</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You can do things more efficiently or you can do less</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Perception > Reality</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Performance is all about effort</strong></li>\n</ul>",

            "html_content": "<p>When it first became a part of JavaScript, I wasn’t sure how much I was going to use async-await.  I could see that it made things prettier in some cases, but I was pretty happy with my promise chains and thought that async-await might just be some extra language baggage.  Since then I’ve fully converted; it’s one of my favorite features added to the language in recent years.  The reason?  It helps you write code in a linear manner.</p>\n<p>A principle of readable code:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Code should where possible be written in the order in which a reader needs to understand it.1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For complex classes, this ideally means that the “entry points” are towards the top, with the helper methods below to be read as needed<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. But for “linear” code that reflects a workflow, we want the code to progress in chronological order as much as possible.  With imperative code that tends to happen by default.  But JavaScript’s asynchronous constructs have tended to obscure chronological orders.</p>\n<p>As an example, here is a React component that displays the time remaining in a user session based off of some cookie values.  It checks a cookie on a regular interval to see whether it should display a warning about the session timeout.  Once it is showing the warning, it begins checking the cookie more frequently in order to show a timeout.  Once the session expires, it can stop checking.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span

            "html_content": "<p>In my recent <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/\">post on Front End Architecture</a> I identified <em>Reliability</em> as a key concern of front end architecture.  I define reliability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An application’s ability to provide a consistent functional experience to all users in the intended audience over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s break that down a bit:</p>\n<p><strong>Consistent</strong> - Reliable applications function the same way over time or degrade gracefully, even on days with heavy load, leap years, and weekends.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional</strong> - Reliable applications allow the users to do the things they need to do, and are forgiving when a user attempts actions that weren’t part of an ideal use case.</p>\n<p><strong>All Users In The Intended Audience</strong> - Reliable applications work for users with strange data who live in different locales, and those with bad network connections and old browsers, at least within the limits of what what the business intends to support.  There is some overlap here with the concept of <strong>accessibility</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Over Time</strong> - In the real world, no application is ever completely reliable.  Things break down, there are bugs, and new edge cases are discovered.  What we can aspire to though, is an application where things that are working consistently stay working consistently, and as bugs, regressions and edge cases are discovered they get fixed in permanent ways.</p>\n<h3>Things Break Down</h3>\n<p>So why are applications often unreliable?  There are a fairly predictable set of issues that most applications run into that degrade reliability.</p>\n<h4>Unexpected Usage Patterns</h4>\n<p>Users are agents of chaos and the real world is stranger than expected.  Your sample database and QA testing doesn’t come close to giving you a true idea of how your application will be used.</p>\n<h4>External Failures</h4>\n<p>Google never has bugs right?  Good luck with that.  Even if the rest of the world always wrote perfect software, front end code usually has to deal with the network, even when your user is on a plane, accessing your site over 2G in the mountains, or just dealing with crappy coffeeshop wifi.</p>\n<h4>Bugs</h4>\n<p>Bugs happen.  When they happen consistently and repeat themselves, you have a reliability problem.</p>\n<h4>Scaling Problems</h4>\n<p>Some things work great on small data sets or with a few users but break down when things get popular.  This isn’t just a backend issue.  Data scales as well as people, and your program needs to be robust to slower backend responses when under load.</p>\n<h3>Keeping Things Running</h3>\n<p>I’d like to offer some practical strategies for overcoming the challenges I’ve listed.  These are things you can consider during code reviews and when setting up your dev processes.</p>\n<h4>1. Consider all states, and limit them if you can</h4>\n<p>One of the big leaps in JavaScript based UI development over the past decade has been moving from systems that we modeled as an initial UI state followed by a series of mutations (server generated HTML + jQuery) to systems that were modeled as partially driven with event systems that caused mutations to the UI (Backbone, Angular 1, Knockout), to systems that model the UI as a function of state (React, Vue, Angular2+, Modern Ember) State-driven systems tend to be more robust, because it is often more clear when a particular state might cause a problem, and it is more obvious when a problematic state occurs for a user how it happened.</p>\n<p>Visibility into state is a huge step forward.  The next step is to define the possible states.  You can do this in your head, but it’s much easier when using types or by thinking in terms of <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/05/14/mobx-state-machines-and-flags/\">state machines</a>.  If you can map out different portions of your applications into a limited set of states and define behavior for each of them, reliability will be much easier to achieve.</p>\n<p>The final step is to limit these states where possible.  Some interfaces depend on user input or external data enough that they naturally are effectively “infinite state machines”, but when you can limit states by cutting scope, rearranging components or cordoning “infinite state machines” off into a smaller area of your application, you gain a lot of benefits.</p>\n<h4>2. Don’t trust the network</h4>\n<p>This one is straightforward, and easy to check in code reviews.  Don’t assume that anything over a network will return quickly.  Don’t assume it will return correctly.  And in fact, don’t assume it will return at all.  You may be limited in how you can handle these possibilities, but the baseline competence here is handling them.  Have strategies for loading states, timeouts, error handling and bad formats.  Things like service workers can help here, but also make the problems around the network even more complicated by introducing a new caching layer.  When you start making calls over a network, you’re entering the realm of distributed systems and things get tricky fast.  But the least you can do is recognize the complexity and make a plan for it.</p>\n<h4>3. Consider variations in data</h4>\n<p>Do you have a test data set that you develop against?  Is that your primary source of validation before you send code off into the wild?  Some of that may be unavoidable and out of your control, but remember that users are agents of chaos.  You will encounter data you didn’t expect, so plan ahead for challenges.  How would your data visualization function if the dataset you ended up displaying was 2x the size of your test database?  10x? 1000x?  What if the list of products to display in your table contained product names 200 characters long?  Or if some of them were empty?  The real world is strange and you should be ready.</p>\n<h4>4. You should have testing</h4>\n<p>This is another topic that’s too big to cover fully here, but basically there’s a reason that QA engineers have jobs.  You should have a plan for testing.  That plan will be better if it contains meaningful amounts of automated regression testing, with a clear process for making sure bugs are tested automatically once they’ve been discovered and fixed.  If you don’t know where to start, always focus on testing the most important things well over testing everything mediocrely. And if you’re not in a position to do meaningful automated testing, consider what it will take to get there.</p>\n<h4>5. Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Finally, sometimes it’s just not possible to catch problems before they ship.  But you can still catch them before too many of your customers do if you put in the work.  I’ll be honest, I’ve never had a monitoring setup that I’ve been happy with at work, but on the front end good monitoring can mean sending console logs over the network so that they’re shared with whatever backend logging solution you’re using, tracking feature usage through analytics to look for any large problems or lack of usage that may indicate bugs, and even more advanced stuff like session recording in some cases.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reliability is an application’s ability to provide a consistent functional experience to all users in the intended audience over time.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Reliability breaks down due to unexpected usage, external failures, bugs, and scaling problems</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You can boost reliability by defining and limiting application states, distrusting the network, thinking about variation in data, testing and monitoring</strong></li>\n</ul>",

            "html_content": "<p>I’ve read 2 things lately that really reminded me of the value of code reviews.  One was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Elk5g8\">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout, which I reviewed <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/12/31/book-review-philosophy-of-software-design/\">here</a>.  Philosophy of Software Design is a practical guide to software design, and Ousterhout emphasizes code reviews as the best point for “practicing architecture” in real world projects.  The 2nd was Sophie Alpert’s recent blog post <a href=\"https://sophiebits.com/2018/12/25/why-review-code.html\">Why Review Code</a>, where she lists the various advantages she’s seen from having code reviews.  I can’t improve on her list, but I can endorse it.  I’ve seen all of the things she listed as benefits from code reviews in the past.  However I’ve seen these benefits come out in some environments more than others.  So I wanted to share 6 practical tips to getting the most valuable possible out of your team’s code reviews.</p>\n<h4>1. Make sure that code reviews are multi-directional</h4>\n<p>When you start doing code reviews, it can be tempting to only have senior developers review code.  After all, they’re the ones who know the system best. But not only do you risk burning out your senior staff that way, you also miss out on some of the biggest benefits of code reviews.  You get different benefits with different team combinations.  I’m using Junior and Senior here relatively speaking, the roles may change over time or in different areas of the codebase.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Senior Reviewing Junior</strong> - This is the first thing most folks think about.  This is an opportunity for a more experienced developer to catch bugs in a less experienced developer’s code and also give suggestions for improving architecture-level structure, introducing new ways of doing things, or catching when there are opportunities for code consolidation that the original author might not have known about.</li>\n<li><strong>Junior Reviewing Senior</strong> - When a less experienced developer reviews the code of a more experienced developer, its an opportunity for them to see new ways of doing things, and also get “cheap” exposure to new areas of a codebase.  It’s also a great opportunity for them to ask questions about things they don’t understand.  But it shouldn’t be a one way street.  Often times a fresh pair of eyes are great at catching bugs, and if a code review is particularly confusing to a less experienced dev, it’s a sign that the code may need to be rewritten or better documented so that it can be maintained in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Peer Reviewing Peer</strong> - When 2 developers have roughly equal skill and experience with the codebase, code reviews are still an opportunity for a second pair of eyes, but they also have the benefits of building team collective knowledge about the codebase and exposing times when there are differences in approach across the team.  Conversations at this level are a great place to standardize on best practices and team conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Hold reviewers responsible for the code they review</h4>\n<p>If a bug makes it past initial development efforts and is caught by QA or ends up in production, who is responsible for it?  Although there will ideally always be layers of accountability here, most developers I know naturally tend to hold themselves responsible when code they wrote breaks something, but also apply the same standard to others.  This can lead to rubber-stamp code reviews when things get busy, since there’s no “skin in the game”.  The benefits of code review tend to come out though, when developers take that same responsibility for the code they review.  A team culture that sees the reviewer and the developer as equally responsible for maintainable code, bug-smashing, and other architecture concerns will lead to better code reviews.  This means treating code review as a core job responsibilities for devs and rewarding those who do it well, rather than just tacking it on.</p>\n<h4>3. Match technology to your process</h4>\n<p>The teams I’ve worked on that didn’t have real code review processes also didn’t have an easy setup to make it work.  They were reviewing diffs manually in their editors or over email.  Tools like Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab have made this much easier.  If you want this to be part of your process, make it as easy as possible.</p>\n<h4>4. Use checklists where appropriate</h4>\n<p>In moderation, I’ve found checklists a useful tool for code reviews.  If your team has specific areas of focus that you want to improve compliance on, it can be helpful to give reviewers a list of items to sign off on.  For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify change supports internationalization</li>\n<li>Verify change doesn’t add any new code with legacy framework</li>\n<li>If change is user-facing, verify it includes documentation updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can take this too far, the review process shouldn’t be reduced to repetitive box-ticking.  But these can be great as guides for implementing new initiatives or addressing problem areas in code.</p>\n<h4>5. Make code reviews as atomic as possible</h4>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">10 lines of code = 10 issues.<br><br>500 lines of code = &quot;looks fine.&quot;<br><br>Code reviews.</p>&mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/397664295875805184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2013</a></blockquote>\n<p>Huge code reviews are overwhelming, and much easier to rubber stamp.  When you develop a culture of creating small focused issues and reviewing each of them, it leads to more interaction and better results. Single issue (atomic) code reviews are best.  As a rule of thumb, if you can describe the change without using the words “and”, “rewrite”, or “a couple of different”, you’re probably doing alright.</p>\n<h4>6. Leave space to make changes</h4>\n<p>Finally, code reviews will have the most value if as a team you’re committed to acting on the feedback received.  That means being supportive when a code review leads to a re-write or refactor.  Sometimes that will need to be delayed of course, but in a healthy process there should usually be time to act on feedback.  This is of course easier if you’ve followed the previous suggestion and kept your code reviews small.</p>",
