[Resilient Management](https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management) is a short and useful read for engineering managers who want to think more systematically about how they support their team.

* Covers the human/soft side of engineering management
* Laraâ€™s strength as a teacher is building meaningful exercises for thinking through abstract topics
* Highlights are the chapter on communicating to the organization, BICEPS model and thinking in terms of group development, plus the leadership colors and Management voltron which had already influenced my thinking
* Not a whole lot of new content here, but the packaging is nice and the content has always been worth the money
