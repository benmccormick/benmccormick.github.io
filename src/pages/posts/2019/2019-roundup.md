2019 was the 6th full year of this blog, and it was a bit up and down posting wise.  For the first half of the year I published more or less a post a week, with 24 posts from January till July.  But this is only my 2nd post since then.  

Turns out that starting a new job while learning to be a parent sucks up a lot of time!  I'm not making any promises for 2020, but I expect that my writing rate will fall somewhere in between the first 7 months and last 5 months of 2019.  In the meantime, here's a brief look back at the year on the blog.

### Kustomer

I shared this in my [newsletter](https://benmccormick.org/subscribe), but one of the reasons 


### Most Read Posts Published in 2018

- [Reusable Code In React: Inheritance, Composition, Decorators and Mixins](https://benmccormick.org/2019/02/11/reusable-react) The most popular post for the year was also one of my favorites: a dive into the various mechanisms React provides for reusing code.


- [Improving Code Readability With Async/Await](https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/28/readable-async) I really like `async/await` but its not always clear how to move older patterns to use it.  This was just a quick example of taking some ugly callback code and converting it to use async await.

- [What's involved in Front End Architecture?](https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/)
Another one of my favorite posts to write, this is a look at what types of things developers should be thinking about when they consider front end architecture.


### Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2019

With all the changes, it hasn't been a big year for experimentation, but Immer is fantastic.

- [Immer](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) This probably deserves a full post at some point, but I've been experimenting with using only Immer and React's built in state features for state management on a new project, and it's been fairly nice so far.  It's a lovely little library that makes working with immutable data pleasant.

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) My other big experiment on the new project has been using Storybook as a collaboration tool for our UI components.  It's still early days, but I'm liking it.

### Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2018

JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, lodash, MobX, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules

### Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2019

I want to try building some small hardware projects and automating them this year.  Something completely different.
