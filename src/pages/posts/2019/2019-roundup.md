2019 was the 6th full year of this blog, and it was a bit up and down posting wise.  For the first half of the year I published more or less a post a week, with 24 posts from January till July.  But this is only my 2nd post since then.  

Turns out that starting a new job while learning to be a parent sucks up a lot of time!  I'm not making any promises for 2020, but I expect that my writing rate will fall somewhere in between the first 7 months and last 5 months of 2019.  In the meantime, here's a brief look back at the year on the blog.

This was my first year where I spent the full year managing people, and that was reflected in the blog's topics as well as where I spent my time.  

### Most Read Posts Published in 2018

- [Reusable Code In React: Inheritance, Composition, Decorators and Mixins](https://benmccormick.org/2019/02/11/reusable-react) The most popular post for the year was also one of my favorites: a dive into the various mechanisms React provides for reusing code.


- [Improving Code Readability With Async/Await](https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/28/readable-async) I really like `async/await` but its not always clear how to move older patterns to use it.  This was just a quick example of taking some ugly callback code and converting it to use async await.

- [What's involved in Front End Architecture?](https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/)
Another one of my favorite posts to write, this is a look at what types of things developers should be thinking about when they consider front end architecture.


### Languages and Libraries I used a lot of in 2019

JavaScript (ES6), React (including hooks), PostgreSQL, lodash, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules, Redux, 

### Tech I want to try in 2019

We're starting to roll out TypeScript at [Kustomer](https://www.kustomer.com/) and I'm excited to use it in production for the first time.  My code time is more limited these days, so that will probably be my main area for learning as I focus more on helping other people get stuff done.
