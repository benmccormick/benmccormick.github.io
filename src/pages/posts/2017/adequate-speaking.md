Tech talks at conferences or meetups generally end up being experienced in one of 4 ways by audience members.


1.  It's a disaster, and that leads to **rage**.

  > This person is not just wasting my time, I don't even understand what he's trying to tell me.  Is this a talk about Vue or just him telling his life story?

2. The talk is executed just fine, but it misses the mark in some way for the audience, leading to **boredom**.

  > The first 5 minutes seemed ok, but it didn't catch my attention, and now I've been on Facebook for 20 minutes and woah are we already wrapping up?  I don't really know how Vue relates to my work.  

3. The talk is perfectly adequate, and the audience leaves with some new and useful **knowledge**.

  > That was really interesting, I'll have to check out Vue soon, it sounds like it would really help me write more maintainable web apps.

4. The talk is incredible and memorable.  It leads to **inspiration**.

  > Wow I'm looking at web development in a whole new way now.  This really changes how I think about my job!


I have no idea how to give a talk that inspires people.  But after speaking a decent amount over the last few years, I've figured out what helps me give talks that can inform most people, and avoid having people leave bored or enraged.  I want to share what I know, because the truth is that giving a talk at a conference or meetup can be fun and rewarding, and I would love it if you too got the chance to enjoy that.  So here are my tips:

## The Pitch

#### 1. Show up!

The only way to give a talk that will interest and inform other people is to actually attempt it.  If you live in a place that has meetups, those are often the easiest place to start.  They're often run by one or 2 people who are going to be grateful to find new people who are willing to speak. Depending on format, you may be able to give a 5 or 15 minute talk along with other speakers at a meetup to ease into things.  If there's no meetup, you can apply to conferences.  Almost all conferences have open "Call for Paper"s, and many of them try to save some spots for new speakers.  Conference speaking is more of a crapshoot though, since they often have many applications for few spots, and your best bet is to apply widely, and possibly suggest several different talk ideas.  This year I applied to speak at 6 conferences, and actually spoke at 2, and that was by far my best ratio since I started applying to speak a few years ago.  

#### 2. Pick a topic that you’re interested in

Giving a talk can be a fun experience, but it can also be frustrating for both you and the audience.  The best way to suck all of the joy out it is to give a talk about something that you don't care about.  If you're uninterested in the topic, the work to prepare is either going to be a painful grind, or you won't do it.  In which case sitting through your talk may well be a painful grind for your audience.  

Note that I don't say to pick a topic you're passionate about.  Not every talk is going to be the pinnacle of your speaking career, and sometimes there may be nothing out there that is currently changing your life.  You can really help people by informing them of the useful, interesting information you have, and this doesn't need to be more than that.

#### 3. Pick an audience for whom that topic is relevant

So you have a talk topic, and that's great, but does your topic make sense for the people you're speaking to?  Sometimes when you start speaking you may pick a topic before you're sure where you're going to give the talk, other times you may have a place you want to speak, and you need to pick a topic for it.  Either way, make sure that you end up with a topic and an audience that match.  If you're talking to a group of beginner web programmers, a deep dive into the Rust memory model might not be the best choice.  If you're speaking to veteran python programmers, a talk about the basics of object oriented programming might miss its mark.  

Sometimes you may not know your audience exactly.  This is especially true for speaking at large multi-track conferences, where there may be developers (and/or non-developers) from a variety of backgrounds.  In this case, you'll still want to pick the audience you want to target (some subset of the group you know may be there), and then make sure to do a good job of following point #6 below.


#### 4. Pick a “main takeaway” for your audience

It's not enough to just have a topic and audience that generally match.  You're also going to want to know what you want the audience to get out of it.  Talking about "debugging" to a JavaScript audience could be a good talk, but do you want them to learn

- how to use Chrome devtools to find performance bugs?
- a repeatable step by step workflow for figuring out any bug?
- a story about how you solved a specific bug?

Unlike the "topic", the takeaway should be pretty specific.  Given the audience that you're targeting, what piece(s) of new information do you want them to receive as they walk away from your talk?

#### 5. Pick a talk format



#### 6. Write a description that tells your audience what to expect


## The Preparation



#### 7. Have slides



#### 8. Have a talk track



#### 9. Make sure your AV works!



## The Delivery

#### 10. Set expectations (again)



#### 11. Be Confident



#### 12. Be Grateful
