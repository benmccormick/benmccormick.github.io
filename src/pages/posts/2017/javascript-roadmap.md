It can be difficult to keep up with all the things going on in web development, especially since the JavaScript language itself has been changing over the last several years.  After several years of relative stability[^1], the ECMAScript spec ([ECMAScript is the specification for the JavaScript language](https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning/)) has changed quite a bit over the last 3 years, with more changes on the way.  In this post I wanted to highlight a few of the resources I use to keep up with the language changes.


[^1]: From the release of the ECMAScript 5 spec to the ES6/ECMAScript2015 spec, the language wasn't exactly stable in practice because browser implementations didn't always move quickly, and there were still many incompatibilities.  But standard language syntax stayed stable for quite a while, which allowed the browser ecosystem to iron out some of those kinks prior to the adoption of ES6.
