> Meetings do not have to be awful.  

I'm sure for some people I just led this post off with heresy of the first order.  It's certainly possible to work in the software industry for years without ever stepping foot in a useful recurring meeting.  Like many things in life, good meetings are designed, they never spring up spontaneously from the ground. The natural state of any recurring meeting is decay and frustration. So how do we fight that?

<More Intro?>

The first step to avoiding meeting-rot is to do a regular review of your meetings.  Quarterly is probably fine here, but if you're feeling swamped with meetings go ahead and do this off schedule.  For every recurring meeting you're in ask yourself whether the meeting is usually efficient and valuable for you.  If not, for the first sweep you can add it to a list.  Once you've accumulated a list of inefficient meetings; and I hope it's not too long, the next question is whether any of these meetings can be eliminated entirely.  If you're the meeting owner that may mean canceling, but for other meetings it may mean that you stop attending.
