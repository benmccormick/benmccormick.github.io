[Marco Arment back in 2011][marco]:

>   For Windows 8 to succeed, especially for its tablets to compete well against the iPad, it will need to adopt a more Apple-like confidence to say “no” to its customers when they ask for everything under the sun. And, surprisingly, they might be doing exactly that.

>One of the reasons Metro is interesting to people like me who usually ignore Microsoft is that it’s full of very un-Microsoft-like decisions, generally for the better.

>The question isn’t whether Metro will be good: it probably will be. And that’s a huge accomplishment for Microsoft that they should be commended for.

>But how will their customers react?

>Will Metro be meaningfully adopted by PC users? Or will it be a layer that most users disable immediately or use briefly and then forget about, like Mac OS X’s Dashboard, in which case they’ll deride the Metro-only tablets as “useless” and keep using Windows like they always have?

Almost 2 years later, this is looking extremely prescient.  I like what Microsoft was attempting to create with Windows 8, and love the Metro/Modern/Whatever style in general, but 8.1 seems to signal most of the effort since has been spent [hedging on it][ars] instead of doubling down, and I can't see how its going to get where it needs to go like that.
