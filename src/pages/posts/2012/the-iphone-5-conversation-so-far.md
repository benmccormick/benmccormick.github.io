~Blog B~: Customers are buying the iPhone 5; Blog A is an idiot.

[Blog C](http://fireballed.org/linked/2012/09/18/jetpack-design/): Smart Companies make boring products.

The 3 reactions after every major Apple news: Apple is overrated, Apple is above reproach, This is what Apple just did, so all companies should do that.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
