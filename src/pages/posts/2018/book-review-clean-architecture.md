[Clean Architecture](http://amzn.to/2mKoejo) by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin was one of the better books on Software Development I've read in recent years.  It did exactly what I want from a software book in 2018: it tackled an important high level topic with a great amount of depth in a way that helped me as a reader to develop insight and perspective on the topic.  These days blog posts and other online sources cover most of my "how to" needs, as well as the simple "what is X and why should I care about it" questions that I used to go to books for.  But there is still no substitute for books when you want an in depth understanding of an important broad topic.

The topic in this case of course is software architecture, and the author is well qualified to discuss it.
