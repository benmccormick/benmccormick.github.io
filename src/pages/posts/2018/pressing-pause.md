Due to a plethora of life events happening this year, I'm going to be putting the blog on pause for a while.  So no more updates through the end of the year.  Will re-evaluate then and hopefully start things back up.  I have plans to take the weekly links stuff I've been doing the past year and turn it into a real email newsletter with a better template, and some exciting ideas for a new blog series.  But I lack the capacity to follow up on them for now.  So Happy Holidays in advance everybody, I hope to be back early next year.
