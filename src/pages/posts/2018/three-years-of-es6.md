Next month will mark the 3 year anniversary of the ES2015 spec, [better known as ES6](https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning).  It was a huge moment in the evolution of JavaScript, a spec update that brought a ton of high level features to the JavaScript language, and the start of a new process of improving the language that so far has resulted in far more transparency and cross-environment compatibility.  It was also the last "big bang" release of JavaScript, as TC39 has now moved to a pattern of annual small releases rather than making large multi-year language releases.  There's been a ton of hype around ES6 over the last 4 years, and I've been writing all of my code using the modern spec during that time[^1] so this seems like a good time to step back and evaluate the features that were added.  What made a big impact on my code, what didn't.  Were there any big mistakes?  So here's one developer's feature by feature look at ES6 after a few years of practice.


### The features I use every day

#### Arrow functions

#### Classes

#### Template Strings

#### Destructuring

#### Modules

#### Promises


#### Default + Rest + Spread  


#### Let


### The features that are useful on occasion

#### Enhanced Object Literals

#### Map + Set


#### Iterators, Generators, and for-of

#### Math + Number + String + Object APIs



### The features that might be nice but aren't for me


#### WeakMap + WeakSet

#### Proxies

#### Symbols

#### Reflect

#### Safe Tail calls


### The features I didn't notice... and that's ok

#### Unicode updates


### The features that maybe could have used some more thought

#### const
