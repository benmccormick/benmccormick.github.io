Hey all.  The blog is still [on pause](https://benmccormick.org/2018/10/13/pressing-pause/), but I wanted to take a moment to share that I'm hiring for my team at [Whatcounts](https://www.whatcounts.com/).

This is a mid-level position focused on coming in and helping me build a new React-based UI for an older Java based SaaS application.  You'll get to work with modern React/JavaScript code and help shape the project[^1].  I'm looking for folks who are comfortable building out complex pages quickly and are knowledgeable about JavaScript, ideally you're at least starting to get comfortable with [these 10 concepts](https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/) and you want to keep growing as a developer.

I'm hiring both in Atlanta GA and Durham NC[^2], so if you're located there and think you'd be a fit feel free to [apply on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/942692404/) or reach out to me directly.



[^1]: I'm actively considering pulling in some other cool tech like Typescript and Storybook, and the person who fills this role will have the opportunity to help make some of those decisions.
[^2]: No remote at this time, sorry folks, although there will be considerable flexibility to work from home a few times a week.
