#### Subscribe To The Newsletter

My newsletter is the best way to follow my writings.  You get:

ðŸ“… **First look at all of the new articles on the blog (around a week before they get posted here)**

ðŸ˜Ž **The coolest stuff that I find around the internet each week**

ðŸ“§ **A more interactive format (I don't support comments on the blog, but I love responding to newsletter replies)**

I'll never spam the list or send more than one email a week.  You can see past mailings [here](https://buttondown.email/benmccormick/archive).

<form
    action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/benmccormick"
    method="post"
    target="popupwindow"
    onSubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/benmccormick', 'popupwindow')"
    class="bd-subscribe-form"
>
    <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
    <div class="bd-subscribe-row large-row">
    <input
        type="email"
        name="email"
        id="bd-email"
        placeholder="Your Email"
    />
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" id="bd-submit" />
    </div>
</form>


#### Subscribe via RSS

If you prefer feeds, you can also subscribe via RSS or Atom.  You'll get access to articles and book reviews as they appear on the blog.
