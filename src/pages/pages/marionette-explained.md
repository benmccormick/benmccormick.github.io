<div class="explanation">
Marionette: Explained was a series of posts I wrote in winter 2014-2015 explaining the whats, whys and hows of Marionette, the Backbone Framework.  Marionette is a powerful set of patterns and components built on top of Backbone.js, a minimalist JavaScript MV* framework. It is widely used in the Backbone community, but since most of the resources I found about it were written prior to it's 2.0 version, and the framework had continued to evolve significantly since then, I felt there was a need for a detailed resource on using it.  This was my attempt at creating that resource.  Note that since I published this, Marionette has released a 3rd major version, Marionette 3.  Most of the concepts here still apply, but some specific syntax may be out of date.

### Acknowledgements

I've had the opportunity to learn a lot from the Marionette team and community through their [gitter room][gitter]. These posts have been much more accurate as a result. I also originally began to understand Marionette after reading [Building Backbone Plugins][bbp] by Derick Bailey, the creator of Marionette. I highly recommend both of those resources to anyone interested in Marionette or Backbone development.
