Hi, I'm Ben McCormick.  I'm a web developer, writer, occasional athlete, and a Christian. This is my blog about JavaScript, the Web and development tools.

I live in Durham NC with my wife Claire, our 2 kids Elena & Elijah and our dog Moxie. Prior to that I grew up in Pittsburgh.  I have plenty of pride in both of my homes.  When I'm not writing code or text, you can find me playing basketball, ultimate frisbee, and board games, relaxing with my wife, or volunteering at my church.  I currently work at [Kustomer](http://www.kustomer.com) as an Engineering Manager.
