I occasionally give talks about JavaScript and software development.  If you're interested in having me speak to your group, feel free to contact me through [email](ben@benmccormick.org).

I am open to talking about pretty much anything that I write about on this blog.  Here are some talks I've given in the past:

## 2017

#### Saving Time With Jest - *All Things Open*

I spoke about Jest at [All Things Open 2017](https://allthingsopen.org/).  This was an expanded version of my Meetup talk from the previous December and was an introductory level talk to Jest and the benefits it provides.

This talk was at the [Modern Web](https://www.meetup.com/trianglemodernweb/) Triangle Meetup. I gave an introduction to [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator built with modern web technologies.

#### The Vim Survival Guide - *Open Source 101 Conference*

- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/vim-survival-guide-71763917)

This talk was at the [Open Source 101](http://opensource101.com/) conference (a one day offshoot of the yearly All Things Open conference).
It was an introduction to Vim, both for those who needed to "survive" Vim on a server, and those
who were interested in using it as their primary editor.

## 2016

#### Saving Time With Jest - *Triangle ReactJS Meetup*

- [Writeup](http://benmccormick.org/2016/12/10/saving-time-with-jest/)

I gave a talk at the first Triangle ReactJS meetup about testing with Jest and how it can save you time.  

## 2015

#### Backbone.js - *Triangle JavaScript Meetup*

- [Slides]( http://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/backbonemeetup)
- [Code](https://github.com/benmccormick/bb-comments/tree/master)

I gave a talk to the Triangle JavaScript Meetup about Backbone and where it fits into today's JavaScript landscape, specifically comparing it to more "modern" frameworks like Angular and React, and demonstrating how you can incorporate new technologies like Firebase and a virtual DOM into a Backbone app.

## 2014

#### Component Based Development - *Triangle DevCon*

- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/component-based-development)

I gave a talk at Triangle DevCon about the web trend towards component based development strategies, going into detail about the Web Components standards as well as the various component implementations from React, Ember, Knockout and Angular.
