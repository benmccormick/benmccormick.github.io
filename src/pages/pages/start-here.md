Hi there!  Welcome to my blog!

I've been writing here since 2012, and the content has evolved over time, but coalesces into a few different major themes.  To make it easier to navigate through the >180 articles on the site, this page serves as a starting point for exploring those themes.

#### Engineering Leadership

Since 2019, a major theme of the blog has been Engineering Leadership, spanning topics relevant to both managers and individual developers.  Recommended posts include [Feedback Loops](/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/), [Lessons From Managing A Distributed Team](/2019/06/24/managing-a-distributed-team), and [Thinking About Values](/2019/06/03/thinking-values).

#### Architecture

I've written a range of posts about software design over the years with a focus on the Front End. Recommended posts include [What's Involved in Front End Architecture](/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/), [React Architecture Confessions](/2018/02/07/react-confessions/), and [6 Keys To Valuable Code Reviews](/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews).

#### JavaScript

JavaScript has been my primary programming language for almost a decade now and I've written quite a bit about the language and the libraries around it.  Most of these posts are tactical so the best posts will depend on your interests, but I've written several posts about [React and it's ecosystem](/topics/react).

#### Software Career Paths

I've occasionally written about building a career in the software industry.  The most popular work here has been my pair of 10 things serious devs should know posts: about [JavaScript](/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/) and [soft skills](/2019/04/15/soft-skills) respectively.

#### Productivity

Another consistent blog theme has been productive software work.  Some of this is high level, but by far the most popular thing I've written here was my [series of posts on being productive in modern Vim](/learning-vim-in-2014).
