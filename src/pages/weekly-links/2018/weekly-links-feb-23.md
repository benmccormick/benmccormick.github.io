### JavaScript And The Web

[Feature watch: ECMAScript 2019 | 2ality](http://2ality.com/2018/02/ecmascript-2019.html) - Not a lot to see here yet, but Axel Rauschmayer has set up a page for tracking the status of the next version of ECMAScript as features advance to stage 4 and become confirmed for the next version of the spec.  No features have been confirmed yet, but worth a bookmark.  He also has links to his detailed articles about the various candidate features if you're interested in seeing where JavaScript is headed next.

[The JavaScript Supply Chain Paradox: SRI, CSP and Trust in Third Party Libraries | Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-javascript-supply-chain-paradox-sri-csp-and-trust-in-third-party-libraries/) - This is a great reminder on why including scripts from 3rd party domains is a risky business, and how to do it securely.

#### Computer Science

After my [post on Computer Science](https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/) this week, I thought I'd share 2 CS-y links I came across this week.

[How to think in graphs: an illustrative introduction to Graph Theory and its applications | Vardan Grigoryan](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401) -  This is a nice "plain language" explanation of basic graph theory.  It's a bit long, but it's a nice thing to look at for the folks who told me this week they want to know more about data structures.

[Learning JavaScript Design Patterns | Addy Osmani](http://amzn.to/2BL3YHo) - One of the better "CS for front end" resources I'm aware of is Addy Osmani's book on JavaScript design patterns.  Like a lot of things in JS land, parts of it haven't aged well now that it's a 6 year old book (it's very focused on jQuery and DOM manipulation in many of its examples), but since it's centered around more timeless design patterns, I think it holds up well.
