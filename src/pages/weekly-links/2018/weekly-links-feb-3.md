### JavaScript And The Web

[ECMAScript 2018 | 2ality](http://2ality.com/2017/02/ecmascript-2018.html) - The spec for the 2018 version of [ECMAScript](https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning/) has been finalized and this is a good roundup of the new features and syntax available.  I'm personally excited for rest/spread properties to be an official part of the language.

It's only a question of when.  But the other question is what the second-level effects of self driving cars will be.  Those who can correctly predict the answer to those two questions are going to have opportunities to make money and create interesting businesses. This is an interesting take on how self-driving cars might affect real estate.
