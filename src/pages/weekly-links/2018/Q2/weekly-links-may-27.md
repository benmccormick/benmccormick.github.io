### Business & Technology

[Gatsby contributors form Gatsby Inc. | Gatsby Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/)

This blog is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and I've [written](https://benmccormick.org/topics/gatsby) and [spoken](https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro) on it a few times in the past.  So I'm really excited to see what happens with the tech as it becomes a company, while continuing to be open source.  It will be really exciting to see where they take it from here, and I think they have a real chance to be successful, especially if they can get a foothold into the ecommerce world.

### Problem Solving

[The Cult of the Root Cause | Donald Reinertsen](http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-cult-of-the-root-cause/)

A really nice short post on problem solving, and how the quest to find the root cause for an issue can sometimes be a distraction.


### Books

[Unbroken | Laura Hillenbrand](https://amzn.to/2sgXJoo)

I've fallen behind on my quest to read 30 books in a year, but this month I was able to read a fantastic book that multiple friends had recommended: Unbroken.  With the [second movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7339792/) based on the book coming out this fall, you'll probably start to hear about this book again.  It's been around since 2010, but I didn't read it when it was first popular, and now I wish I had.  It is an amazing story of human perseverence, surviving trauma, and ultimately grace.  It doesn't oversimplify the human beings whose lives it chronicles, but still manages to shine on a light on the best and worst of the human condition.  Highly recommended.
