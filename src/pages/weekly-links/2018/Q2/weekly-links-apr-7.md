### JavaScript and the Web


[React Lifecycle Diagram | Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509)

Dan shared a really great illustration of the React lifecycle methods on twitter that can help you internalize how they work if you're unfamiliar.

[Announcing the Second Edition of “Refactoring”](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201803-refactoring-2nd-ed.html)

The upcoming second edition of [Refactoring](https://amzn.to/2IzhmhS) will have it's code examples written in JavaScript.  I'd love to see more architecture-level books written for JavaScript developers.  I don't think we have great definitive resources for those questions yet, and rewriting a classic with JS examples is a great first step.

This is a small thing, but I thought Chrome's experimental support for external display controls was cool, and may eventually lead to me actually using one of the many JS based presentation tools instead of Keynote.

### Tech

[Former Uber Backup Driver: We Saw This Coming | Citylab](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/03/former-uber-backup-driver-we-saw-this-coming/556427/)

May be some sour grapes here, but the piece raises some interesting questions about the transition from our current state to a self-driving car future, and whether a [Level 3](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/path-to-autonomy-self-driving-car-levels-0-to-5-explained-feature) self driving car is even a feasible goal.

[The Stack Overflow Age | Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/06/the-stack-overflow-age/)

Stack Overflow had a huge influence on my early days learning JavaScript.  I love seeing the history here from one of the founders.

### Humor

One of the funnier stories I've read on the internet in a while.
