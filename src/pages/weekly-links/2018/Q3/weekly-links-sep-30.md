### Javascript & the Web

[Principles of Component API Design | Chris Schmitz](https://hackernoon.com/principles-of-component-api-prop-design-bb20cd58da54)

Good advice for designing React components


### Programming Tools

[Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)

A new Git tool from the makers of Sublime Text.  Looks lightning fast, good looking and usable.  Exactly what you'd expect.  I'm not a big UI guy for Git, but I'll be playing with this, and it might be my new go-to recommendation.


### Book Review

[The Everything Store | Brad Stone](https://amzn.to/2OqjY8u)

Still finishing this one up, but can already recommend it.  A great look into the creation of one of the most important companies in the world.  I was pretty interested to read about how intense Jeff Bezos is, and how hard he ran the early employees of Amazon.  I hadn't realized that he fell into the Steve Job's school of CEO-hood.
