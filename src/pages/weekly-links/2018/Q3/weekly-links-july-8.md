A small list this week as it's a holiday in the states.  So fewer articles out there, and I'm sure I missed some of them.

### Programmer Life

[My Lessons from Interviewing 400+ Engineers | First Round Review](http://firstround.com/review/my-lessons-from-interviewing-400-engineers-over-three-startups/)

I'm nowhere near Marco's experience level interviewing, but his advice in this "interview on interviewing" resonates with my experience.  Things that stood out to me:

- Don't overoptimize on a specific skillset as a startup, since you don't know what skills you need yet.
- It's incredibly important (but also quite difficult) to be consistent in your standards across all interviewees
- Team interviewing works better than 1 on 1 interviews for evaluating technical skills and team fit.

[Diggâ€™s v4 launch: an optimism born of necessity | Will Larson](https://lethain.com/digg-v4/)

An engineering horror story.

[Anti-Flow | Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/anti-flow/)

Rands remains my favorite software blog because of his ability to capture truths about the engineer condition with beautiful words.
