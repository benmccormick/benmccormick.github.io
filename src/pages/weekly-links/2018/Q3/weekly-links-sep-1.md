[Reverse Engineering React | Angular In Depth](https://blog.angularindepth.com/practical-application-of-reverse-engineering-guidelines-and-principles-784c004bb657)

A really cool look at how you can approach a new code base and start learning how it works quickly

This looks like "JSCOdeshift for Python" to me: a way to quickly update codebases to use new patterns and practices.  I love it. You can [check out my experience using JavaScript Codemods here](https://benmccormick.org/2018/06/18/codemod-survival/)


[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
