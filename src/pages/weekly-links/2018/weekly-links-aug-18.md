### JavaScript and the Web

[Bits | Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/bits/)

I'll pretty much always link performance posts that do a good job laying out the challenges in a way that respects both the technical and business POV.  Ethan advocates here for a more structural view to performance problems on the web and wonders how we can find more performant ways to solve businesses revenue problems.

[React Community Resources | Egghead](https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/react)

Egghead has accumulated a pretty amazing set of beginner React resources that are free for non-members.  If you're trying to get into React, this is a pretty good place to start.

### Books

[Radical Candor | Kim Scott](https://amzn.to/2vX6yGo)

I may write this up as a full review later, but Radical Candor was the best book I've read this year.  It's a book for managers, but it really was just one of the best books I've ever read on communication and relationships.  If you want to work better with others, Radical Candor is worth buying.
