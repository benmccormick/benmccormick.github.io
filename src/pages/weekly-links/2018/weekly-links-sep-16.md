### Javascript & the Web

[The 12 Things You Need to Consider When Evaluating Any New JavaScript Library | Sacha Greif](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-12-things-you-need-to-consider-when-evaluating-any-new-javascript-library-3908c4ed3f49)

This is a smart set of criteria to consider when looking at new tools.  I'd add that it's always worth comparing a library to a "do it without the library" approach, to make sure you understand the benefits that you're getting for your specific project.

### Leadership

[Newsletter | Lara Hogan](https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=1f50ce22f02ed0ffc80c10aff&id=8c0f947e69)

I've already linked several of [Lara Hogan's](https://larahogan.me/) blog posts in this space, and now she's started an email newsletter.  Worth checking out.

### Book Review

[Ready Player One | Ernest Cline](https://amzn.to/2xfflEi)

I'm about 7 years late on this (and even 6 months late for the movie hype), but Ready Player one was a great little sci-fi novel that uses 80's pop culture as a background for a bunch of insightful commentary about our modern tech culture and where it may be heading.  A lot of fun, and worth reading if you've missed it for this long like me.
