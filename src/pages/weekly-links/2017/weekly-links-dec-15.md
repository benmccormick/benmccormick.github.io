### JavaScript And The Web

[The State Of JavaScript 2017](https://stateofjs.com/) - This annual survey of JavaScript developers always has lots of interesting insights.  Since it is an internet survey, I view it less as a full snapshot of the industry, but more as a place to see what is new and trending in the JS world.  This year [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) caught my eye as spiking in popularity.

[The Glimmer Binary Experience | LinkedIn Engineering](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/12/the-glimmer-binary-experience) - I had the privilege of seeing Yehuda Katz, one of the Ember core developers, give a talk about [Glimmer](https://glimmerjs.com/) and bytecode at this year's All Things Open conference.  They're doing some pretty serious software engineering in the Ember community right now.  This write-up covers a lot of the same ground and is worth a read.

### Programming Tools and Practices

[Atom 1.23](http://blog.atom.io/2017/12/12/atom-1-23.html) and [Visual Studio Code 1.19](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_19) were released this week, making this a big week for Electron based text editors.  If you use either of them, you'll get to enjoy a nice set of performance improvements when you upgrade.

[Bear 1.4](https://blog.bear-writer.com/bear-1-4-the-tags-edition-298d6fdc55dd) - Speaking of software that I love to use getting updates, I've been using Bear as my primary notes app for the last year, and it is a delight.  Getting autocomplete on tags this week solved it's last real annoyance for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a simple notes app.  It's more powerful than Apple's notes or text files, but cleaner and more elegant than [Evernote](https://evernote.com/).  And even the paid level is very affordable.
