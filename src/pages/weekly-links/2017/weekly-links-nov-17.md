### JavaScript And The Web


[Currying In JS | 2ality](http://2ality.com/2017/11/currying-in-js.html) - A nice round up of the different approaches for using currying (a functional programming concept) in JavaScript.  My favorite line: *"One of JavaScriptâ€™s best traits is how many different styles of programming it can accommodate."* This is one of my favorite things about the language as well.

[Thoughts on Redux and its similarities with OOP | Dhruv Rajvanshi](https://medium.com/@dhruvrajvanshi/thoughts-on-redux-and-its-similarities-with-oop-6d200f34656) - I always find it useful to understand when core concepts are shared across very different looking tools and paradigms

### Programming Tools and Practices

[Entering the Quantum Eraâ€”How Firefox got fast again and where itâ€™s going to get faster | Lin Clark](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/) - I've been using Firefox 57 as my primary browser this week and so far it is very very nice.  Other than a single Chrome-specific extension that I'm missing, and a few minor devtool annoyances, everything has worked great.  And it is blazing fast.

[Introducing Visual Studio Live Share | Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share) and
[Code together in real time with Teletype for Atom | Github](https://blog.atom.io/2017/11/15/code-together-in-real-time-with-teletype-for-atom.html)  - In what appears to be a crazy coincidence, both Atom and Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code announced new tools for collaborating with other developers on code, using a google docs-like experience.  Atom's solution is available in beta today, and is a free WebRTC based peer-to-peer solution for editing code together, with the primary user sharing their active tab with anybody who has the uniqueID for your session.  It also includes open-sourcing a library that would let other editors implement its document protocol. Microsoft's solution is more ambitious, supporting both Visual Studio and Visual Studio code, and allowing users access to a whole shared workspace.  It is just an announcement for now though, and it's not clear if it is a peer to peer or centralized solution, nor whether it will have a cost associated with it.  Regardless, both solutions look amazingly cool.

[Managing Humans | Michael Lopp (AKA Rands)](http://amzn.to/2AVaAjx) - This book was a great roundup of some of the best writings from one of my favorite blogs [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/).  Michael Lopp has been a manager and executive at Netscape, Apple, Palantir, Pinterest and now Slack.  He's seen a lot.  While the book is aimed first at managers, it's helpful for anyone who is interested in understanding how engineering teams work, and how to lead or work in one better.


### Non-Tech

[On the Table, the Brain Appeared Normal | The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/sports/aaron-hernandez-brain-cte.html?_r=0) - Powerful reading about the dangers of football, a sport that I still love watching.  [More context here if you're confused after reading the NYT story](https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/09/21/aaron-hernandez-brain-cte-video-photos).

[Security Breach and Spilled Secrets Have Shaken the N.S.A. to Its Core | The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html?_r=0) - Interesting to see such mainstream questioning of the NSA's habit of hording zero-day exploits.  Don't read this one if you want to maintain any naive good feelings about US cybersecurity.
