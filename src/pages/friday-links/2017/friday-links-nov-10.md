I started this new thing last week, *Friday Links*.  There's a [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/MwEtFrDwFWzXSRv13) if you're a regular reader and want to tell me what you think of it.  Otherwise, enjoy the links!

### JavaScript And The Web

 [Slaying a UI Antipattern in React – JavaScript Inside](https://medium.com/javascript-inside/slaying-a-ui-antipattern-in-react-64a3b98242c) - This is an interesting case study of how to work through an architectural problem using React.  I love seeing posts like this that take real world scenarios (I deal with this case of having data that might be in one of several loading states all the time), and identify re-usable patterns for solving them.

 [Netflix functions without client-side React, and it’s a good thing - JakeArchibald.com](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/netflix-and-react/) - A nice look at what Netflix's experience removing client-side react from their landing page means and doesn't mean.  I'm going to be really curious to see how the JS community gets better at enabling fast initial experiences while still having full rich interactivity when the users need it.

### Programming Tools and Practices

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Prettier put out a new release this week and now supports Markdown as well as JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and GraphQL.  It has been my favorite new tool of 2017, solving a problem I didn't know I had: the mental overhead of constantly reformatting my own code.  

[The Pragmatic Programmer - Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas](http://amzn.to/2zvm12Z) - Not a new book at all, but I like to recommend it at every opportunity.  It's my favorite resource on the practice of Software Engineering and well worth checking out if you've never read it.

### Non-Tech

[Once considered a boon to democracy, social media have started to look like its nemesis - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21730870-economy-based-attention-easily-gamed-once-considered-boon-democracy-social-media) - This is a wide-ranging take on the downsides of social media with a focus on it's deleterious effects on our political systems.  If you're on social media and/or you care about the future of politics in your place of living, it is worth a read.
