Drew Neil is the creator of <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/\">vimcasts</a>, the popular online Vim site.  And this book is his attempt to explain what makes Vim special.  It’s bursting cover to cover with practical tips and tricks to help you become a more efficient writer and developer.  Reading it helped me understand the philosophy behind Vim, and I would recommend it for anyone who uses Vim or thinks they might want to.  There’s a reason I recommend it as the Vim resource on my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/readinglist/\">reading list</a>.</p>\n<p>So how do you get a copy?
