These type of advocacy pieces have a tendency to clump all businesses together a bit too much<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, but Addy is pretty reasonable about that and it’s important for every front end dev to understand these tradeoffs and problems, even if they don’t need to make them top priority for every project.</p>\n<h3>Programming Tools</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/on-switching-code-editors/\">On Switching Code Editors | Chris Coyier</a></p>\n<p>I’m in the middle of possibly switching to VSCode from Atom, which I switched to from Vim, which I switched to from Sublime Text, which originally introduced me to a world beyond overweight IDEs like Eclipse.  So I can relate to this article, and it’s a great framework for thinking through switches.  I will say, I don’t necessarily think I’ve made the best choices here.  I’m not sure that since I’ve learned Vim keybindings, any of my switches have actually increased my productivity.

Framer X is still in a private beta, so it will be interesting to see what happens when it goes public.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Even in 2018, not everyone is serving 3rd world businesses or gets a large chunk of their traffic from mobile.
