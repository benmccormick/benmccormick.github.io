I’m glad that I did.  The book is a great experience for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the JavaScript language in a practical grounded fashion.</p>\n<h3>Whats the book like?</h3>\n<p>The subtitle of the book, “68 Specific Ways To Harness The Power Of JavaScript”, gives you a hint as to what it will be like.  The book contains 68 best-practice”items”, each an imperative sentence (Prefer Primitives to Object Wrappers, Get comfortable using Higher-Order Functions), divided into 7 chapters (Accustoming yourself to JavaScript, Variable Scope, Objects and Prototypes,  Arrays and Dictionaries, Library and API design, Concurrency).  Each of these items contains an in depth examination of why it is a best practice.  You could read through the table of contents and get something out of the book, but the heart of this book is the way that the author fully digs into each best practice, explaining not only why its a good idea but also what the exception cases are, and why it might be a good idea to break the rule.  The way the discussion of language attributes is grounded by the practical imperative statements, combined with the clear and concise explanations of the author makes everything feel extremely relevant.</p>\n<h3>Who is the book for?</h3>\n<p>This is a great book for people who are familiar with JavaScript, and maybe know some of the best practices, but want to deepen their understanding of how the language works and how to use it better.  This is not a comprehensive reference book, or an introductory text for people just starting with Javascript.  I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026691/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026691&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1118026691\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596517742\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> respectively for those cases.  This book will increase understanding, not knowledge of the syntax or basics.</p>\n<h3>What is good about the book?</h3>\n<p>The layered explanations are fantastic.  On the top layer the author gives you the <strong>specific</strong> best practices, then follows that with an explanation of the underlying reasons for these practices, gives examples of them in action, and following up with any cases where it might be best to use a different method.  The book communicates clearly and concisely about complex subjects.  The payoff is understanding.</p>\n<h3>What is not so great?</h3>\n<p>I felt the chapter on Library and API design was significantly weaker than the rest of the book.  Perhaps it’s because I’m not currently working on building a library, but these chapters felt less like deep explanations and more like quick writeups to justify the stating of the best practices.  The depth of the other explanations was not there.</p>\n<h3>Want to buy it?</h3>\n<p>Its available on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321812182/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321812182&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=HOPC6ZNKSVMH3NZ7\">Amazon</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321812182\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\n.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/06/book-review-effective-javascript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Book Review","Jasmine","Testing"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Javascript Testing with Jasmine","description":"A book review of JavaScript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn","layout":"post","path":"/2013/04/23/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine","date":"2013-04-23T20:30:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I received a copy of Javascript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn this week, and it seemed like perfect timing.  The developers on my team at work have been discussing using Jasmine to automate the testing of Javascript code in our product, and I may be spending a significant amount of time with it soon.  I was hoping to pick up on some tips and tricks, and maybe learn some things about testing.  It ended up being a quick read with some useful tidbits that left me wanting more.</p>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>Javascript Testing with Jasmine is a short little book about testing with Jasmine, a testing framework inspired by the Behavior Driven Development style.  The book is short (only 52 pages), which is appropriate for its limited scope. It’s split into 7 chapters with each chapter comprised of a few pages of example and explanation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is Software testing?</li>\n<li>Jasmine</li>\n<li>Writing good tests</li>\n<li>Matchers in depth</li>\n<li>More Jasmine Features</li>\n<li>Spies</li>\n<li>Using Jasmine with other tools</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What’s it like?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately the book manages to simultaneously feel like its filling space in many spots, and like it missed opportunities to provide value in others. Chapters 4 and 5 for instance fail to say much that is not already in Jasmine’s <a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">“describe by showing”-style documentation.</a> Chapter 1 seems to be searching for interesting things to say about testing, and failed to meaningfully explain the distinction between BDD and generic Test Driven Development.  The section on Jasmine and Coffeescript in Chapter 7 could be succinctly summarized as “Yes you can use Jasmine with Coffeescript”.  At the same time, the book misses opportunities to talk about things like writing testable code, or refactoring existing code to be meaningfully tested with Jasmine. I would have loved to see more about automating testing and fitting it into the development process, or running tests from the command line with phantomJS.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that there’s nothing good here.  I found the explanation of spies to be very helpful, and the detailed documentation-like aspects would be more helpful to a Javascript beginner than Jasmine’s <strong>“show me the code”</strong> docs.  All in all the book serves as a great reference guide for the library.  I’m just not sure how much value it adds compared to a quick Google search.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>In the end this feels like the type of book that made sense before Google took over the Internet.  It provides all the basic how-tos and background information, but fails to provide any deep insight.  If you’re starting a new Javascript BDD project and want a quick reference this may make sense as a quick reference guide, but for most people the information in here can be found just as easily with a little use of your favorite search engine and a trip to the Jasmine docs.</p>\n<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>\n<p>You can get it from Amazon here: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449356370/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449356370&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=JTR6CUZAHM7HLHOQ\">JavaScript Testing with Jasmine (Affiliate Link)</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449356370\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">Jasmine Home Page</a> - Learn more about Jasmine straight from the source</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine\">Medium Equals Message</a> - another review of the book from Chris Webb</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This review is part of the <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/bloggers/\">O’Reilly Blogger Program</a>.

The book does a good job of laying out the basic tools and processes of user-centered design, like usability studies, surveys, and project plans.  It also argues convincingly for the power  of its central points: user focus, preparation, and a structured process.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a deep dive into design theory, this is probably not a book you want.  Rather than dig into abstract design issues, this book instead acts as a survey of the user-centered design landscape, and points you to resources to go deeper if a particular topic catches your interest.  Lowdermilk also does a good job of pointing out examples of the different principles discussed, though for a stretch of the book he appears to be a bit fixated on a small selection of examples, particularly 53 Inc.’s popular iPad app <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend this book for developers who want to open their minds to design considerations and improve their ability to make usable products.  It particularly seems suited for the engineer who knows technically how to implement features and write good code, but is still figuring out how to write applications that delight users.  I’d especially recommend it for team leads or independent developers who are more likely to be able to meet users and be a part of managing requirements.  I think all engineers could benefit from the books emphasis on the users point of view, but the real benefits will come to those who are able to make its suggestions part of the structure of their product workflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449359809/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449359809&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=5XN7KS7FCBFHZ54O\">Buy User-Centered Design on Amazon (Affiliate Link)</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449359809\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"></p>\n<p>This review was part of the <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/bloggers/\">O’Reilly Blogger Program</a>.

A lot of books have titles that promise great things, and content that under-delivers and disappoints.  Every once in a while, though, you find a gem that does the opposite. <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> sounds like a niche book for library developers.  But it actually is the best resource on <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.JS</a> development I’ve found, a book that will benefit anyone who works with Backbone.</p>\n<p>So what’s the fuss about?  The book’s author, Derick Bailey, is the creator of <a href=\"http://marionettejs.com/\">Marionette.JS</a>, a popular application framework for Backbone Apps.  <em>Building Backbone Plugins</em> explores the problems that Derick tried to solve with Marionette and then explains the mindset behind Marionette’s solutions.  It is not a book exclusively about Marionette though.  The solutions in the book are example code that represents a simplified view of what Marionette does.  Instead the book looks at the common problems any developer will encounter in a Backbone project, and provides a possible solution, while working hard to generalize the lessons and concepts as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Building Backbone Plugins is divided into 4 parts.  The first two look at Backbone Views and dealing with the DOM.  The third looks at Models and Collections.  The last part deals with application structure and events.  These are followed by a series of appendices that read as stretched-out blog posts on a variety of related topics that didn’t quite fit into one of the 4 buckets that the rest of the book falls into.  </p>\n<p>In my mind, the first two parts are the heart of the book.  They’re a step-by-step look at how you can remove repetitive code from your Backbone Views and structure your application to expose the developers intent in each file, rather than burying the purpose in boilerplate. I learned a lot about how I could improve my Backbone code, and these two sections actually inspired me to start integrating Marionette into a project at work. The application structure advice in the fourth part is also particularly strong, with quality information about events, and ideas on how to scale a Backbone application beyond TodoMVC sizes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the appendices feel a bit tacked on, and seem to be full of stuff the author wanted to add but couldn’t figure out how to weave into the rest of the book.  Since it’s legitimate content rather than simply greater detail on things that have been already covered, they don’t act as real appendices and leave the book feeling a bit unfocused at the end. When you combine that with some weaker content in part 3 (where the author moves away from Marionette into some other smaller examples), the book can feel a bit choppy and directionless.  But the goldmine of knowledge and perspective in Parts 1, 2 and 4 more than make up for it.  </p>\n<p>I would not recommend BBP as a “first book” on Backbone.  It assumes plenty of knowledge, and doesn’t attempt to teach Backbone basics.  But for an intermediate level Backbone developer, or any Javascript developer who wants to grow their thinking about application structure, there is plenty of solid insight here. Meditations on handling nested views, cleaning up unused views, abstracting out repetitive boilerplate, and structuring genuinely large applications are all worth the price of the book.  Finally, if you’re writing code using Marionette already, this book is a must-have.  Marionette’s documentation does a great job of explaining the “what” and the “how” of Marionette.  But this book explains the all-important “why” of a framework that is based on encoding Backbone best practices into a library. It will help you think like an experienced Backbone developer.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> - You can purchase the book on leanpub.

Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.

Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 145.51495016611295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-6abcb.png 143w,\n/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-c6ee5.png 285w,\n/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"react-confessions,large-improvements-small-team,ll-context","topics":["Architecture","Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"clean-architecture-book","title":"Book Review: Clean Architecture","description":"Uncle Bob's book on architecture is informative, but limits its scope","layout":"post","path":"/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/","date":"2018/02/14","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mKoejo\">Clean Architecture</a> by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin was one of the better books on Software Development I’ve read in recent years.  It did exactly what I want from a software book in 2018: it tackled an important high level topic with a great amount of depth in a way that helped me as a reader to develop insight and perspective on the topic.  These days blog posts and other online sources cover most of my “how to” needs, as well as the simple “what is X and why should I care about it” questions that I used to go to books for.  But there is still no substitute for books when you want an in depth understanding of an important broad topic.\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1516226851&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+architecture&linkCode=li2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=c599845decc4e5ed1457acae2a375ad6\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img border=\"0\" class=\"inline-img\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0134494164&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=benmccormicko-20\" ></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0134494164\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\nFor this book, that topic is software architecture.  The book tackles it by starting with some history, and then starting with a micro view before expanding out its gaze.  After giving a broad overview of the different software paradigms, Martin walks readers through 3 levels of architecture principles: class-level design principles, component-level component principles and system-level architecture principles.  At each level he shows the similarities between the lower level principles, as well as the unique concerns at each scale. Then he wraps it up with a case study example that shows the principles discussed throughout the book in action.</p>\n<p>I found Clean Architecture to be a great reminder of concepts I learned in school<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> that I didn’t properly appreciate at the time due to a lack of practical experience.  It brought home to me that while there are some architectural things I do pretty well right now, like keeping code separated enough that it only has one reason to change, there are other things that I don’t do well a lot of the time.  For me the biggest realization was how much grief I’ve caused myself the last few years from failing to keep high level policies from depending on low level details.  The book gave me a few new lenses to examine my decisions with, and definitely inspired me to spend more time taking a step back to see the big picture as I’m adding new features.  </p>\n<p>For me, that sense of perspective was the biggest win, but if you’re looking for detailed “how tos”, there’s a decent amount of that as well.  Martin goes into details about how to arrange and refactor classes to create maintainable systems that are easy to change, as well as identifying patterns to look for that may be a sign of problems to come.  He goes pretty deep into the weeds with examples and class diagrams as he discusses creating proper system boundaries and pulls it all together with a nice case study example at the end.  </p>\n<p>While I did find Clean Architecture extremely helpful overall, I do have some nitpicks.  The biggest for me personally is that while the book mentions dynamic languages like Ruby and Python a few times, it mostly does so in passing to say that the principles mention still apply, but may look different.  Since this is usually not expanded upon, and all of the examples given seem to assume static languages that provide abstract interfaces to classes, it is sometimes hard to see how the books principles should be applied to the dynamic languages that I use daily.  I would love to have seen more detail there.  Also, the final chapter of the book “The Missing Chapter” was a bit of an oddity.  It was written by a different author<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, framed issues that had already been covered differently, and came to some different conclusions than the rest of the book.  It was almost a counterpoint to the other parts of the book, which could have been interesting, but lacked an introduction or context to help explain its purpose.  Overall it left me a bit confused and ended the book on a discordant note rather than bringing the ideas together and focusing me on the important ideas.</p>\n<p>I can recommend <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mKoejo\">Clean Architecture</a> for anyone who wants to get better at thinking about the big picture when it comes to software systems, particularly if you haven’t already been exposed to any of the theory behind designing maintainable systems.  If you’re usually working in static languages on larger projects, I would double that recommendation, as you’ll be right in the book’s wheelhouse.  For those like me working with dynamic languages on web projects, it may be a bit more hit or miss, but it still is a great way to broaden your horizons and gain some new ways of thinking about the tradeoffs our work entails.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I was a Computer Science major, but if you weren’t exposed to theories of software architecture through a curriculum</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This was not obvious to me on first reading, I only went back and noticed the acknowledgement on the chapter page when I was confused by a 3rd person reference to the author.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"clean-architecture-book,large-improvements-small-team,react-confessions","topics":["Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"inmates-book","title":"Book Review: The Inmates Are Running The Asylum","description":"Don't judge a book by its first few chapters","layout":"post","path":"/2018/04/11/book-review-inmates-are-running-the-asylum/","date":"2018/04/11","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz\">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>\n<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>\n<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>\n<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>\n<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>\n<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>\n<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>\n<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.  If you want a more practical and in the weeds design resource, then <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a> is probably a better bet.  But <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz\">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> is still solid reading.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/04/11/book-review-inmates-are-running-the-asylum/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"react-confessions,clean-architecture-book,ll-context","topics":["Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"visual-display-review","title":"Classic Book Review: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","description":"A data visualization modern classic","layout":"post","path":"/2018/03/12/classic-book-review-visual-display/","date":"2018/03/13","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>If you have any interest at all in data visualization, you can’t get very far learning about it without hearing the name Edward Tufte.  His four books on the subjects have had a huge influence on the industry over the last 35 years, a time where data visualization has blossomed as it has moved from a tedious hand drawn task to a computer assisted activity that even middle schoolers can attempt with the software available on most laptops.</p>\n<p>Tufte’s first book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f\">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> is also his most well known and acclaimed book<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.

They shouldn’t mislead the reader.</li>\n<li>Remove unecessary clutter</li>\n<li><em>and more</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book is also beautiful.  Tufte chose to self-publish it so that he could control the exact layout and typography.  He also mixes in many old hand drawn visualizations to mix with a fewer new computer assisted graphics.  The result is stunning, and makes for a very enjoyable read throughout, as there is always something interesting to look at.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"A typical page\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-da4c7.jpg 143w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-1d39e.jpg 285w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg 570w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-9d77e.jpg 855w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-e356a.jpg 1140w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-4208b.jpg 1710w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I was pleased to find that the book didn’t back up some of my own pre-conceived notions about Tufte and his work.  When I’ve seen him referenced in the past, it has been almost solely in terms of minimalism.  He was an expert witness for fewer colors, fewer lines, less ink.  But his takes here are more nuanced.

Simple things should be displayed simply.  If you have a single number, don’t dress it up in a fancy graph.  Just show the number.  If you have a series of numbers, a table or simple scatter will work fine, no need for a fancy piece of chart “art”.

I’m glad that I did.  The book is a great experience for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the JavaScript language in a practical grounded fashion.</p>\n<h3>Whats the book like?</h3>\n<p>The subtitle of the book, “68 Specific Ways To Harness The Power Of JavaScript”, gives you a hint as to what it will be like.  The book contains 68 best-practice”items”, each an imperative sentence (Prefer Primitives to Object Wrappers, Get comfortable using Higher-Order Functions), divided into 7 chapters (Accustoming yourself to JavaScript, Variable Scope, Objects and Prototypes,  Arrays and Dictionaries, Library and API design, Concurrency).  Each of these items contains an in depth examination of why it is a best practice.  You could read through the table of contents and get something out of the book, but the heart of this book is the way that the author fully digs into each best practice, explaining not only why its a good idea but also what the exception cases are, and why it might be a good idea to break the rule.  The way the discussion of language attributes is grounded by the practical imperative statements, combined with the clear and concise explanations of the author makes everything feel extremely relevant.</p>\n<h3>Who is the book for?</h3>\n<p>This is a great book for people who are familiar with JavaScript, and maybe know some of the best practices, but want to deepen their understanding of how the language works and how to use it better.  This is not a comprehensive reference book, or an introductory text for people just starting with Javascript.  I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026691/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118026691&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1118026691\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=productjavasc-20\">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=productjavasc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596517742\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"> respectively for those cases.  This book will increase understanding, not knowledge of the syntax or basics.</p>\n<h3>What is good about the book?</h3>\n<p>The layered explanations are fantastic.  On the top layer the author gives you the <strong>specific</strong> best practices, then follows that with an explanation of the underlying reasons for these practices, gives examples of them in action, and following up with any cases where it might be best to use a different method.  The book communicates clearly and concisely about complex subjects.  The payoff is understanding.</p>\n<h3>What is not so great?</h3>\n<p>I felt the chapter on Library and API design was significantly weaker than the rest of the book.  Perhaps it’s because I’m not currently working on building a library, but these chapters felt less like deep explanations and more like quick writeups to justify the stating of the best practices.  The depth of the other explanations was not there.</p>\n<h3>Want to buy it?</h3>\n<p>Its available on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321812182/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321812182&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=HOPC6ZNKSVMH3NZ7\">Amazon</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321812182\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\n.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/06/book-review-effective-javascript"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Book Review","Jasmine","Testing"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Javascript Testing with Jasmine","description":"A book review of JavaScript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn","layout":"post","path":"/2013/04/23/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine","date":"2013-04-23T20:30:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I received a copy of Javascript Testing with Jasmine by Evan Hahn this week, and it seemed like perfect timing.  The developers on my team at work have been discussing using Jasmine to automate the testing of Javascript code in our product, and I may be spending a significant amount of time with it soon.  I was hoping to pick up on some tips and tricks, and maybe learn some things about testing.  It ended up being a quick read with some useful tidbits that left me wanting more.</p>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>Javascript Testing with Jasmine is a short little book about testing with Jasmine, a testing framework inspired by the Behavior Driven Development style.  The book is short (only 52 pages), which is appropriate for its limited scope. It’s split into 7 chapters with each chapter comprised of a few pages of example and explanation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is Software testing?</li>\n<li>Jasmine</li>\n<li>Writing good tests</li>\n<li>Matchers in depth</li>\n<li>More Jasmine Features</li>\n<li>Spies</li>\n<li>Using Jasmine with other tools</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What’s it like?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately the book manages to simultaneously feel like its filling space in many spots, and like it missed opportunities to provide value in others. Chapters 4 and 5 for instance fail to say much that is not already in Jasmine’s <a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">“describe by showing”-style documentation.</a> Chapter 1 seems to be searching for interesting things to say about testing, and failed to meaningfully explain the distinction between BDD and generic Test Driven Development.  The section on Jasmine and Coffeescript in Chapter 7 could be succinctly summarized as “Yes you can use Jasmine with Coffeescript”.  At the same time, the book misses opportunities to talk about things like writing testable code, or refactoring existing code to be meaningfully tested with Jasmine. I would have loved to see more about automating testing and fitting it into the development process, or running tests from the command line with phantomJS.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that there’s nothing good here.  I found the explanation of spies to be very helpful, and the detailed documentation-like aspects would be more helpful to a Javascript beginner than Jasmine’s <strong>“show me the code”</strong> docs.  All in all the book serves as a great reference guide for the library.  I’m just not sure how much value it adds compared to a quick Google search.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>In the end this feels like the type of book that made sense before Google took over the Internet.  It provides all the basic how-tos and background information, but fails to provide any deep insight.  If you’re starting a new Javascript BDD project and want a quick reference this may make sense as a quick reference guide, but for most people the information in here can be found just as easily with a little use of your favorite search engine and a trip to the Jasmine docs.</p>\n<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>\n<p>You can get it from Amazon here: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449356370/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449356370&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=JTR6CUZAHM7HLHOQ\">JavaScript Testing with Jasmine (Affiliate Link)</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449356370\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine//\">Jasmine Home Page</a> - Learn more about Jasmine straight from the source</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/book-review-javascript-testing-with-jasmine\">Medium Equals Message</a> - another review of the book from Chris Webb</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This review is part of the <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/bloggers/\">O’Reilly Blogger Program</a>.

The book does a good job of laying out the basic tools and processes of user-centered design, like usability studies, surveys, and project plans.  It also argues convincingly for the power  of its central points: user focus, preparation, and a structured process.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a deep dive into design theory, this is probably not a book you want.  Rather than dig into abstract design issues, this book instead acts as a survey of the user-centered design landscape, and points you to resources to go deeper if a particular topic catches your interest.  Lowdermilk also does a good job of pointing out examples of the different principles discussed, though for a stretch of the book he appears to be a bit fixated on a small selection of examples, particularly 53 Inc.’s popular iPad app <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<p>I’d recommend this book for developers who want to open their minds to design considerations and improve their ability to make usable products.  It particularly seems suited for the engineer who knows technically how to implement features and write good code, but is still figuring out how to write applications that delight users.  I’d especially recommend it for team leads or independent developers who are more likely to be able to meet users and be a part of managing requirements.

A lot of books have titles that promise great things, and content that under-delivers and disappoints.  Every once in a while, though, you find a gem that does the opposite. <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> sounds like a niche book for library developers.  But it actually is the best resource on <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.JS</a> development I’ve found, a book that will benefit anyone who works with Backbone.</p>\n<p>So what’s the fuss about?  The book’s author, Derick Bailey, is the creator of <a href=\"http://marionettejs.com/\">Marionette.JS</a>, a popular application framework for Backbone Apps.  <em>Building Backbone Plugins</em> explores the problems that Derick tried to solve with Marionette and then explains the mindset behind Marionette’s solutions.  It is not a book exclusively about Marionette though.  The solutions in the book are example code that represents a simplified view of what Marionette does.  Instead the book looks at the common problems any developer will encounter in a Backbone project, and provides a possible solution, while working hard to generalize the lessons and concepts as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Building Backbone Plugins is divided into 4 parts.  The first two look at Backbone Views and dealing with the DOM.  The third looks at Models and Collections.  The last part deals with application structure and events.  These are followed by a series of appendices that read as stretched-out blog posts on a variety of related topics that didn’t quite fit into one of the 4 buckets that the rest of the book falls into.  </p>\n<p>In my mind, the first two parts are the heart of the book.  They’re a step-by-step look at how you can remove repetitive code from your Backbone Views and structure your application to expose the developers intent in each file, rather than burying the purpose in boilerplate. I learned a lot about how I could improve my Backbone code, and these two sections actually inspired me to start integrating Marionette into a project at work. The application structure advice in the fourth part is also particularly strong, with quality information about events, and ideas on how to scale a Backbone application beyond TodoMVC sizes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the appendices feel a bit tacked on, and seem to be full of stuff the author wanted to add but couldn’t figure out how to weave into the rest of the book.  Since it’s legitimate content rather than simply greater detail on things that have been already covered, they don’t act as real appendices and leave the book feeling a bit unfocused at the end. When you combine that with some weaker content in part 3 (where the author moves away from Marionette into some other smaller examples), the book can feel a bit choppy and directionless.  But the goldmine of knowledge and perspective in Parts 1, 2 and 4 more than make up for it.  </p>\n<p>I would not recommend BBP as a “first book” on Backbone.  It assumes plenty of knowledge, and doesn’t attempt to teach Backbone basics.  But for an intermediate level Backbone developer, or any Javascript developer who wants to grow their thinking about application structure, there is plenty of solid insight here. Meditations on handling nested views, cleaning up unused views, abstracting out repetitive boilerplate, and structuring genuinely large applications are all worth the price of the book.  Finally, if you’re writing code using Marionette already, this book is a must-have.  Marionette’s documentation does a great job of explaining the “what” and the “how” of Marionette.  But this book explains the all-important “why” of a framework that is based on encoding Backbone best practices into a library. It will help you think like an experienced Backbone developer.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> - You can purchase the book on leanpub.

Figuring out a career path is hard for software developers.  Talking to some people, you’ll get the impression that we face a pretty bleak binary choice.  Behind door number #1 lies a relatively rapid path to a “senior developer” role, followed by stagnation the rest of your career as you reimplement the same solutions in new technologies for minimally increasing pay over time, until youth-friendly tech culture decides that you’re too old to be useful.  Door #2 serves basically as an escape hatch, as you trade the opportunity to work with code for a path into management, where you receive a few more pay raises in return for your soul.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 145.51495016611295%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Talking with Tech Leads Cover\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-6abcb.png 143w,\n/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-c6ee5.png 285w,\n/static/twtl-d49491b6d9865b188e60ea7340d2c7ce-0a9fb.png 301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’m not that cynical, and hopefully not that dramatic, but as a relatively young developer it’s been hard to figure out what I want from a career and harder still to know exactly what different options would look like if I got there.  I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"react-confessions,large-improvements-small-team,ll-context","topics":["Architecture","Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"clean-architecture-book","title":"Book Review: Clean Architecture","description":"Uncle Bob's book on architecture is informative, but limits its scope","layout":"post","path":"/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/","date":"2018/02/14","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mKoejo\">Clean Architecture</a> by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin was one of the better books on Software Development I’ve read in recent years.  It did exactly what I want from a software book in 2018: it tackled an important high level topic with a great amount of depth in a way that helped me as a reader to develop insight and perspective on the topic.  These days blog posts and other online sources cover most of my “how to” needs, as well as the simple “what is X and why should I care about it” questions that I used to go to books for.  But there is still no substitute for books when you want an in depth understanding of an important broad topic.\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1516226851&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+architecture&linkCode=li2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=c599845decc4e5ed1457acae2a375ad6\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img border=\"0\" class=\"inline-img\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0134494164&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=benmccormicko-20\" ></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0134494164\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">\nFor this book, that topic is software architecture.  The book tackles it by starting with some history, and then starting with a micro view before expanding out its gaze.  After giving a broad overview of the different software paradigms, Martin walks readers through 3 levels of architecture principles: class-level design principles, component-level component principles and system-level architecture principles.  At each level he shows the similarities between the lower level principles, as well as the unique concerns at each scale. Then he wraps it up with a case study example that shows the principles discussed throughout the book in action.</p>\n<p>I found Clean Architecture to be a great reminder of concepts I learned in school<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> that I didn’t properly appreciate at the time due to a lack of practical experience.  It brought home to me that while there are some architectural things I do pretty well right now, like keeping code separated enough that it only has one reason to change, there are other things that I don’t do well a lot of the time.  For me the biggest realization was how much grief I’ve caused myself the last few years from failing to keep high level policies from depending on low level details.  The book gave me a few new lenses to examine my decisions with, and definitely inspired me to spend more time taking a step back to see the big picture as I’m adding new features.  </p>\n<p>For me, that sense of perspective was the biggest win, but if you’re looking for detailed “how tos”, there’s a decent amount of that as well.  Martin goes into details about how to arrange and refactor classes to create maintainable systems that are easy to change, as well as identifying patterns to look for that may be a sign of problems to come.  He goes pretty deep into the weeds with examples and class diagrams as he discusses creating proper system boundaries and pulls it all together with a nice case study example at the end.  </p>\n<p>While I did find Clean Architecture extremely helpful overall, I do have some nitpicks.  The biggest for me personally is that while the book mentions dynamic languages like Ruby and Python a few times, it mostly does so in passing to say that the principles mention still apply, but may look different.  Since this is usually not expanded upon, and all of the examples given seem to assume static languages that provide abstract interfaces to classes, it is sometimes hard to see how the books principles should be applied to the dynamic languages that I use daily.  I would love to have seen more detail there.  Also, the final chapter of the book “The Missing Chapter” was a bit of an oddity.  It was written by a different author<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, framed issues that had already been covered differently, and came to some different conclusions than the rest of the book.  It was almost a counterpoint to the other parts of the book, which could have been interesting, but lacked an introduction or context to help explain its purpose.  Overall it left me a bit confused and ended the book on a discordant note rather than bringing the ideas together and focusing me on the important ideas.</p>\n<p>I can recommend <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mKoejo\">Clean Architecture</a> for anyone who wants to get better at thinking about the big picture when it comes to software systems, particularly if you haven’t already been exposed to any of the theory behind designing maintainable systems.  If you’re usually working in static languages on larger projects, I would double that recommendation, as you’ll be right in the book’s wheelhouse.  For those like me working with dynamic languages on web projects, it may be a bit more hit or miss, but it still is a great way to broaden your horizons and gain some new ways of thinking about the tradeoffs our work entails.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I was a Computer Science major, but if you weren’t exposed to theories of software architecture through a curriculum</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This was not obvious to me on first reading, I only went back and noticed the acknowledgement on the chapter page when I was confused by a 3rd person reference to the author.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"clean-architecture-book,large-improvements-small-team,react-confessions","topics":["Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"inmates-book","title":"Book Review: The Inmates Are Running The Asylum","description":"Don't judge a book by its first few chapters","layout":"post","path":"/2018/04/11/book-review-inmates-are-running-the-asylum/","date":"2018/04/11","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz\">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>\n<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>\n<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>\n<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>\n<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>\n<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>\n<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>\n<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.  If you want a more practical and in the weeds design resource, then <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IItvkP\">About Face</a> is probably a better bet.

The result is stunning, and makes for a very enjoyable read throughout, as there is always something interesting to look at.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"A typical page\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-da4c7.jpg 143w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-1d39e.jpg 285w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-6fbc3.jpg 570w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-9d77e.jpg 855w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-e356a.jpg 1140w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-4208b.jpg 1710w,\n/static/typical_page-837a29b8f105a7a5fc6997272618c5f6-bc278.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I was pleased to find that the book didn’t back up some of my own pre-conceived notions about Tufte and his work.  When I’ve seen him referenced in the past, it has been almost solely in terms of minimalism.  He was an expert witness for fewer colors, fewer lines, less ink.  But his takes here are more nuanced.  He definitely tends towards minimalism, and argues for reducing graphs to their bare minimum ink amount over conforming to familiar forms<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  But his go to example of great data display throughout the book is hardly minimalist.  Minard’s map of Napoleon invading Russia is a complex visualization that tracks the size of an army, time, location and temperature, all in a single image.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-11c68.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 48.17708333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Minards Map of Napoleon Invading Russia\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-13239.png 855w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/minards-map-a9f2089f64e1e722501e3dd99a14b48e-11c68.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead Tufte is really arguing for data efficiency.  Simple things should be displayed simply.  If you have a single number, don’t dress it up in a fancy graph.  Just show the number.  If you have a series of numbers, a table or simple scatter will work fine, no need for a fancy piece of chart “art”.  But when you have truly complex data, a complex visualization can make it accessible in ways that a large page of words and numbers never could on its own.</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f\">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> fun, informative and inspirational.
