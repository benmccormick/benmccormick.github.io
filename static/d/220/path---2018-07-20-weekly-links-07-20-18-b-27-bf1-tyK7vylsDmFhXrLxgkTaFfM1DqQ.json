One of the best front end reads I’ve seen this year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal\">What’s Happening With the Pipeline (|>) Proposal? | James DiGioia</a></p>\n<p>An update on the proposal to add a pipeline operator to JavaScript.  I am not the target audience of this proposal, as I don’t regularly write in the nested miniature function style that is aided by this proposal, but I would really love to see some real world code (not fabricated examples) that would have their readability improved by this proposal. The smart pipelines proposal in particular seems like it’s adding a bunch of new syntax for developers to learn and tooling to support.  Since this is a “sugar” feature and doesn’t add new capabilities, I really wonder whether it’s worth it.</p>\n<h3>Leadership and Teams</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://boz.com/articles/p-rules.html\">The P Rules | Andrew Bosworth</a></p>\n<p>Design Reviews are one of my favorite parts of my job, and this is a great set of rules for having good ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/\">Feedback Equation | Lara Hogan</a></p>\n<p>So this is back to back weeks with links from Lara, and there’s a good reason for it.  This is a great framework for speaking the truth to somebody with humility.</p>\n<h3>Startups</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atrium.co/blog/b2b-vs-b2c/\">Why I love B2B over B2C | Justin Kan</a></p>\n<p>I’ve worked at B2B companies my whole career, so I’m biased I guess, but unless you just like playing the lottery, its tough to see why you’d prefer B2C from a pure financial perspective.</p>\n<h3>Random</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-vcErOPofQ\">Grace Hopper on Letterman in 1986 | YouTube</a></p>\n<p>This clip is just wonderful.  A little slice of history, touching the computer industry, the greatest generation, and the roots of our current late night comedy scene.  “There was a time when everyone in this country did one thing together” is an amazing statement in our current political environment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: July 20th","keywords":"","category":"opinion","date":"2018/07/20","path":"/2018/07/20/weekly-links-07-20-18/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/07/20/weekly-links-07-20-18/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/07/20/weekly-links-07-20-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2017/12/01/weekly-links-12-01-17/","data":{"title":"Weekly Links: December 1st 2017","path":"/2017/12/01/weekly-links-12-01-17/","description":"flatMap is Stage 3, Firefox 57 is impressive, and cities will do a lot for Amazon","date":"2017/12/01","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2017/11/10/friday-links/","data":{"title":"Weekly Links: November 10th 2017","path":"/2017/11/10/friday-links/","description":"React, Social Media, and Comments","date":"2017/11/10","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2017/12/23/weekly-links-12-23-17/","data":{"title":"Weekly Links: December 23rd 2017","path":"/2017/12/23/weekly-links-12-23-17/","description":"Math in JS, Google vs Apple Maps, and cheating at Settlers","date":"2017/12/23","category":"opinion"}}]}}
