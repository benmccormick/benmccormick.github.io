Might have a full post on that soon, but for now, there‚Äôs a good point here.</p>\n<p>React is relatively simple at it‚Äôs core, but it‚Äôs difficult to find examples of using it in the wild, that don‚Äôt require you to learn Webpack/Babel/npm at minimum, and many ‚Äústarting points‚Äù will also toss in Redux/React Router/Jest/etc as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mweststrate/mobx-5-the-saga-continues-4852bce05572\">MobX 5: the saga continues‚Ä¶ | Michael Weststrate</a></p>\n<p>MobX is the first major library I‚Äôve seen to take advantage of proxies to give normal looking JavaScript objects/arrays magic powers<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  This sort of ‚Äújust make it work in the prettiest way possible‚Äù API is the type of thing that tends to produce really cool results as long as it works correctly 100% of the time, but becomes a huge pain as soon as it‚Äôs flaky.  I‚Äôve never had any problems with MobX after using it for 2 years, so I‚Äôm hopeful seeing them as an early adapter here.  Will be interested to see if they start getting used more widely going forward.  If so, I hope that browser start thinking about how they can expose these types of patterns well in developer tools.  How do you drop into a side effect caused by a proxy in a debugger?  It‚Äôs an interesting problem</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2ality.com/2014/12/es6-proxies.html\">Meta programming with ECMAScript 6 proxies | 2ality</a></p>\n<p>In case I lost anybody with my discussion of the last link, here‚Äôs an old but good walkthrough of what Proxies are and how you can use them to create some pretty magical APIs.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Buying Github</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://changelog.com/spotlight/14\">üî• Our reactions to Microsoft buying GitHub |Adam Stacoviak &#x26; Jerod Santo</a></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://changelog.com/\">Changelog</a> podcast that summarizes the reaction of the 2 primary Changelog hosts to the annoucement as well as collecting reactions from around the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/martenbjork/github-xp\">github-xp | M√•rten Bj√∂rk</a></p>\n<p>This is just fun.
