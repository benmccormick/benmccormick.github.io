{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Business &#x26; Technology</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/\">Gatsby contributors form Gatsby Inc. | Gatsby Blog</a></p>\n<p>This blog is built on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>, and I’ve <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/topics/gatsby\">written</a> and <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro\">spoken</a> on it a few times in the past.  So I’m really excited to see what happens with the tech as it becomes a company, while continuing to be open source.  It will be really exciting to see where they take it from here, and I think they have a real chance to be successful, especially if they can get a foothold into the ecommerce world.</p>\n<h3>Problem Solving</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-cult-of-the-root-cause/\">The Cult of the Root Cause | Donald Reinertsen</a></p>\n<p>A really nice short post on problem solving, and how the quest to find the root cause for an issue can sometimes be a distraction.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sgXJoo\">Unbroken | Laura Hillenbrand</a></p>\n<p>I’ve fallen behind on my quest to read 30 books in a year, but this month I was able to read a fantastic book that multiple friends had recommended: Unbroken.  With the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7339792/\">second movie</a> based on the book coming out this fall, you’ll probably start to hear about this book again.  It’s been around since 2010, but I didn’t read it when it was first popular, and now I wish I had.  It is an amazing story of human perseverence, surviving trauma, and ultimately grace.  It doesn’t oversimplify the human beings whose lives it chronicles, but still manages to shine on a light on the best and worst of the human condition.  Highly recommended.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: May 27th","keywords":"gatsby","category":"opinion","date":"2018/05/27","path":"/2018/05/27/weekly-links-05-27-18/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/05/27/weekly-links-05-27-18/"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"2018-05-27-weekly-links-05-27-18-067","internalComponentName":"Component20180527WeeklyLinks052718","path":"/2018/05/27/weekly-links-05-27-18/","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/2018/05/27/weekly-links-05-27-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]},"updatedAt":1529431477552,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/2018/05/27/weekly-links-05-27-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]}}
