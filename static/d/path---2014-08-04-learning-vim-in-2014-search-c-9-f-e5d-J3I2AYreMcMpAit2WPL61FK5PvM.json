{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Have you ever tried to summarize something that was just too big to explain?  I’ve covered a lot of ground in my posts on Vim this past month, but it’s only scratched the surface of what Vim has to offer.  The goal was to create a foundation that people could start with, and then let them build on their own. There’s not a conclusive way to say what somebody “needs to know” when learning Vim.  Most people don’t (and shouldn’t) use every feature of the editor, they use the ones that make sense for them.  So I’ve tried to cover the things that I know people have found useful, and the philosophy behind how Vim works, and then let you figure out what you’d like to use on your own.  This post wraps up the series, but I wanted to highlight one last feature of Vim, its fantastic search capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Vim has an extremely powerful built in search tool.  To use it, you can type <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> at anytime in normal mode to start entering search terms.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code> followed by enter searches for the next occurrence of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document.  You can then skip over matches with <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> or go backwards with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code>.  If you wanted to start by searching backwards, you could have started with <code class=\"language-text\">?foo</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code>, in which case <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> would reverse behavior, with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> moving forward in the document and <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> moving back.  It’s easiest to think of <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> as “next match” and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> as “previous match”, with the direction determined by the search operator, <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">?</code>.</p>\n<p>The search tool can be used for more than simple literal expressions, it also takes regular expressions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">/fo.\\|bar</code> will match <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">fox</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  You also can search for lines containing both foo and bar with the expression <code class=\"language-text\">/.*foo\\&amp;.*bar</code>.  If you want to dig deeper into Vim’s regex language, I’d recommend typing in <code class=\"language-text\">:h pattern</code> to check out the excellent documentation.</p>\n<h3>Substitute</h3>\n<p>Search is great, but in many cases what we want to use it for is replacing or acting on each instance.  Vim’s search and replace command looks something like <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/foo/bar/g</code>, which will replace all occurences of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  Let’s break that down a bit.  <code class=\"language-text\">:s</code> (substitute) is Vim’s search and replace command.  By default it only works on the current line, so in order to get it to act on the whole document I prepended the <code class=\"language-text\">%</code> character, which sets the range to include everything.  If you want a smaller range, you can select the text you want to act on in visual mode. Typing <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> will then preload the range into the command area.  Substitute takes an expression in the form <code class=\"language-text\">/&lt;search expression&gt;/&lt;replace string&gt;/&lt;modifiers&gt;</code>  where search expression defines the search, replace string is the text to substitute in, and modifiers are single letter arguments that change the behavior.  By default only the first instance of an expression per line is substituted, so I added the <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> modifier to tell Vim to substitute all instances of the search expression on a line.  Other useful modifiers are <code class=\"language-text\">i</code>, which makes the search case insensitive, and <code class=\"language-text\">c</code> which has Vim prompt for confirmation before substituting each instance. Confirmation is helpful if you want to change most but not all occurences of a phrase. One useful behavior of substitute to be aware of: If you leave the search expression blank, it reuses your last search.  So if you’ve been playing around with a regex to get the right expression, once you get it right you can type <code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;replacement&gt;/g</code>, and it will replace all instances, without forcing you to retype your complicated regex.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that search plays nicely with Vim’s <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">composable actions</a>, and you can use it as a motion command with <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">c</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> or other actions.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">d/foo</code> will delete all text up to the next occurence of foo in the document. <code class=\"language-text\">y?foo</code> will yank all text backwards to the previous occurence of foo in the document.</p>\n<h3>Inline Searching</h3>\n<p>Along with the primary search and substitute commands, Vim has other specialty searching tools.  One of these is its <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> commands. <code class=\"language-text\">f&lt;char&gt;</code> moves to a single character on the current line.  While less powerful than <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, this can be super useful because of its quick composability and guarantee of not moving out of the current scope.  It’s really easy to type <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> to delete through the end of the parentheses.  <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> works similarly, but is non-inclusive, so you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ct)</code> to delete everything up to and not including the parentheses.  I remember it as “change find character” and “change to character” respectively.  Like <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, these commands support backwards and repeated search.  <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">T</code> search backwards on the current line, and <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> are the default commands for “next match” and “previous match” respectively.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file searching with vimgrep and grep</h3>\n<p>Searching within a file is nice, but what if you want to search in multiple files?  Vim provides 2 commands for that.  The first, <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep</code>, uses Vim’s internal regex engines to search across multiple files. You could for instance type <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep /function/i ./*.js</code> to search all Javascript files in the current directory for the “function” keyword.  You’d then be able to loop through them using the <code class=\"language-text\">:ln</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:lp</code> commands.</p>\n<p>The second command, <code class=\"language-text\">:grep</code>, integrates with an external search application (grep by default), to do the searching.  The advantage of the first is that it’s portable and will be available anywhere and everywhere that Vim is.  But generally external tools are going to be faster than Vim’s internal search engine.  Grep for instance is faster than vimgrep.  I personally use the external tool <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> which is faster than grep.  Regardless though, Vim has support for whatever approach you choose to take.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file replace with the arglist</h3>\n<p>Up till now we’ve mostly been dealing with tasks that Vim has good answers for.  If you want to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim though, you end up in some of the more esoteric parts of Vim-land.  In order to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim, you need to first define a set of files to edit, and then run the replace command.  Unfortunately there is no way in Vim to cleanly do this all in a single command.  Instead you must pull your list of files from one of 3 places, the arglist, the buffer list, or the window list.  The arglist is by default the files that you specified to open when you initially opened Vim, the buffer list is your list of currently opened buffers, and the window list is the list of files in currently open windows.  Since you probably don’t want to have to open or view all the files that you want to run a search/replace on, and you may want to have files open or visible without running a replace on them, the arglist is the list of choice for replacements.  Vim allows you to edit the contents of the arglist at any time using the <code class=\"language-text\">:argadd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">argdelete</code> commands.  So to replace <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code> for all javascript files in the current directory you might type something like.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">:argd * &quot;Clear arglist\n:arga ./*.js  &quot;Add javascript files\n:argdo %s/foo/bar/g &quot;Substitute on each file</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">argdo</code> is the command to execute a command across all files in the arglist.  <code class=\"language-text\">bufdo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">tabdo</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">windo</code> work the same way for every “open buffer”, “active window in each tab”, and “window in the current tab” respectively. Personally I find this all to be a pain.  A single command that let you specify an action and a range to run it on like <code class=\"language-text\">:do &#39;%s/foo/bar/g&#39; ./*.js</code> would make plenty of sense.  But since that doesn’t exist, it’s worth at least knowing that the arglist is there, and being able to resort to it if necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Power Of Search</h3>\n<p>Most people start out using Vim knowing that they can move around with <em>hjkl</em> and switch between files with <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code> as they learn more they grow their toolbox. Search is a great tool for moving quickly around text in Vim, and for powerfully making big edits.  Searching allows you to allow your brain to focus on the big picture, rather than remembering exactly where each piece of code or content is located. Like everything else in Vim, it’s a tool that you can combine with other tools to create powerful workflows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/\">Vimcasts</a> has a nice piece on the <code class=\"language-text\">gn</code> command, an alternative to <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> that lets you select the next search match in visual mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace\">Vim’s wiki</a> also has a nice writeup of the <code class=\"language-text\">:substitute</code> command, with lots of examples and details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Search","keywords":"vim, search","category":"tools","date":"2014-08-04T01:16:20+00:00","path":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","layout":"post","hideFooter":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"2014-08-04-learning-vim-in-2014-search-c9f","internalComponentName":"Component20140804LearningVimIn2014Search","path":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/learning-vim-in-2014","data":{"title":"Learning Vim in 2014","path":"/learning-vim-in-2014","description":"A series of beginner level articles on Vim","date":null}},{"path":"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies","data":{"title":"Vim Workflows: File Switching","path":"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies","description":"A look at the different approaches you can take to managing files in Vim","date":"2014-11-10T04:06:52+00:00"}},{"path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","data":{"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language","path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","description":"An explanation of the grammar behind Vim","date":"2014-07-02T11:27:00+00:00"}}]},"updatedAt":1531140554594,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/learning-vim-in-2014","data":{"title":"Learning Vim in 2014","path":"/learning-vim-in-2014","description":"A series of beginner level articles on Vim","date":null}},{"path":"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies","data":{"title":"Vim Workflows: File Switching","path":"/2014/11/10/vim-workflows-file-switching-strategies","description":"A look at the different approaches you can take to managing files in Vim","date":"2014-11-10T04:06:52+00:00"}},{"path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","data":{"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language","path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","description":"An explanation of the grammar behind Vim","date":"2014-07-02T11:27:00+00:00"}}]}}
