This looks like the first working version of that I‚Äôve seen.  I‚Äôm excited to play with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/bat\">bat: A cat(1) clone with wings | David Peter</a></p>\n<p>This looks like a really cool project, a ‚Äúcat‚Äù clone with syntax highlighting and git line indicators.  Lot‚Äôs of cool stuff being written in Rust these days.</p>\n<h3>Tech and Business</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm\">Amazon Letter To Shareholders | Jeff Bezos</a></p>\n<p>I originally saw this letter in an article on <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/\">Stratechery</a>, (and that piece is also great).  It‚Äôs one of the best short pieces on business that I‚Äôve ever read.  The Stratechery piece breaks down the idea of ‚Äúdivinely discontent customers‚Äù, which is an amazing image.  But the other advice about how to set and maintain high standards is even better.  Just great stuff, from the leader of one of the most important companies in the world.</p>\n<h3>Fun</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhoff/status/991408768171855873\">‚ÄúWhat the customer really wanted üòè‚Ä¶ ‚Äú</a></p>\n<p>This is a new variant on one of my favorite programming jokes<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What the customer really wanted üòè <a href=\"https://t.co/sDTbQsZb3U\">pic.twitter.com/sDTbQsZb3U</a></p>&mdash; Jayme Hoffman (@jhoff) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhoff/status/991408768171855873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>If anyone knows where the original version of this joke is from let me know and I‚Äôll credit it.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">‚Ü©</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: May 5th","keywords":"mdx cat bat amazon bezos","category":"opinion","date":"2018/05/05","path":"/2018/05/05/weekly-links-05-05-18/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/05/05/weekly-links-05-05-18/"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"2018-05-05-weekly-links-05-05-18-f17","internalComponentName":"Component20180505WeeklyLinks050518","path":"/2018/05/05/weekly-links-05-05-18/","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/2018/05/05/weekly-links-05-05-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]},"updatedAt":1529435338509,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/2018/05/05/weekly-links-05-05-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]}}
