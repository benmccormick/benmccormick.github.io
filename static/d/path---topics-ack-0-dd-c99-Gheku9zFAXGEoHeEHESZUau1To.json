Frustrated by grep’s weird syntax or slow IDE search tools?  <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">Ack</a> is a tool like grep designed for programmers.  I use it for searching my source code to track down sections of code or look for occurences of a variable or reference.  It’s a simple open-source tool that does one job well, and does it with blazing speed.</p>\n<p>Ack performs a subset of grep’s functionality, optimizing for the programmer’s use case. In the simplest usage it will allow you to enter an expression, and will search files in the current directory/subdirectory for it, ignoring version control artifacts like .svn and .git files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># search all files in current directory recursively\n# to see if they contain &quot;foobar&quot;\nack foobar</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ack then spits out nicely formatted output with the full file paths and line numbers of each occurence.

Because of ack’s sensible defaults and focused design, these basic commands cover about 80% of what I’m looking for from a code search tool. But for those who want to do a bit more, ack can be much more powerful.  Because ack is written in perl, any perl-compatible regular expression can be used to search your files.  Ack provides plenty of options for formatting the output and it’s also very easy to filter by filetype.</p>\n<p>For instance, I have a small side project where I’m creating an event signup site with the front end code written in CoffeeScript.  If I want to see which files I’ve referenced events in without necessarily seeing all the details, I can use the <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> flag to only show file names.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-7c4ee.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 68.41379310344827%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"filenames only\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-7c4ee.png 725w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Obviously this search brings up several types of files. Along with the CoffeeScript files I’m interested in, ack shows some html and css files, as well as a random server side file.  It also shows the generated JavaScript files.  I could get rid of these files by specifying a different root directory, but instead I’m going to show ack’s  smart filtering by filetype.  To search only coffeescript files, I just need to add the <code class=\"language-text\">--coffee</code> flag to see all CoffeeScript matches.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-bc4cb.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 42.685589519650655%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"ack filetype filtering\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-13239.png 855w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-bc4cb.png 916w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Its also easy to add multiple filetype flags in order to search several filetypes, and you can even define custom filetype flags with an .ackrc file.  These also let you specify default options and set certain directories to be ignored on a global or per-project basis.</p>\n<h4>Other Options</h4>\n<p>Ack is hardly the only code search tool out there.  It’s meant to improve on grep by focusing on the programmer’s use cases, but there are <del>many</del> some situations where grep is still a good option.  Ack is situationally optimized for searching code, <del>and doesn’t work as well for filtering piped output</del>. Grep is also installed on many remote servers where you won’t have access to ack.  So ack makes a great complement to grep, moreso than a replacement.</p>\n<p><em>Update: You can totally use Ack to filter piped output.  Another reason to use grep gone.</em></p>\n<p>In terms of direct competition, <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\">ag</a> is an attempt to improve on ack, mostly in terms of speed. Ag uses various tricks to optimize speed performance for code search, using an ack compatible syntax. Since its written in C rather than perl, it is indeed significantly faster.  I personally am more comfortable with ack.  Its more mature, has better documentation, and has always been fast enough for me.</p>\n<p><del>Ag was not updated to support ack 2’s filetype filtering, and generally seems to have focused on speed over all else.</del>  It also has dependencies that I’ve found are a problem on old operating systems. Ack only depends on perl, and is thus very portable, even to Windows systems.  Still, if you find ack to be slow on your code base, or just like knowing you’re doing everything as fast as possible, ag is a great alternative.</p>\n<p><em>Update: As of version 0.22.0 ag supports ack’s filetype syntax, but does not allow you to define custom file types, a very useful ack feature.</em></p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>If you’ve been using grep or slow GUI tools to search your source code, you can do better. Ack is fast, easy to use, and optimized for programmers.  It’s also free, open-source code you can use without cost or licensing worries.  If you want to go even faster, consider using ag.  Just make sure you’re using a tool that was built for the work you’re doing.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,look-at-ack,interesting-atom","topics":["Ack","Command Line"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Ack Tips","description":"A set of tips for using Ack, a command line search tool","layout":"post","path":"/2016/04/30/ack-tips","date":"2016-04-30T15:48:25+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>Last summer I briefly considered creating a separate blog focused on command line tools.

I ended up scrapping the idea, but had written a few posts on one of my favorite command line tools Ack, so I wanted to preserve them here, as a single, longer piece, separated into 3 “tips”</em></p>\n<h3>#1: Prefer ack or ag to grep</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/grep\">grep</a> is one of the most well known unix utilties.  If you’ve had any exposure to the command line at all, you’ve probably searched for something using grep.  grep’s standalone use is searching for content inside of files, but with Unix’s piping philosophy it is useful as a general search and filtering tool.  Originally created for Version 4 Unix 42 years ago, it has been a staple of *Nix operating systems ever since.   If you’ve been using it for even half that time, I’m sure a blog post isn’t enough to convince you to stop.  But for the rest of us, there’s an opportunity to do better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\">ag</a> <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> are similar projects with the same goal: providing a better experience than grep when searching directories of files, particularly for programmers.  The key selling points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved speed when searching through directories</li>\n<li>Ignores version control and binary files by default when searching</li>\n<li>Easy filtering by file-type</li>\n<li>A cleaner API for searching directories, without adding complexity to the single file case</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is easiest to see by comparing commands.</p>\n<h4>Searching for “javascript” in a file</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep javascript foo.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript foo.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every file in the current directory for “javascript”</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript .</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every file in the current directory for “javascript”, excluding a .git directory</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript . $(find . -type f | grep -v &#39;\\.git&#39;)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every HTML file in the current directory for “javascript”, excluding a .git directory</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript . $(find . -name &#39;*.html&#39; -or -name &#39;*.htm&#39;| grep -v &#39;\\.git&#39;)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack --html javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Basically, as the complexity of what you’re trying to do increases in terms of multiple files, the overhead of using grep increases proportionately.  Because ack and ag are optimized for common use cases, they’re able to scale much better.</p>\n<h3>#2: Use Ack to get familiar with a new codebase</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> is an incredibly useful tool when approaching a new codebase, especially if you’re focused on a specific feature. It allows you to quickly get a view of the codebase, and then zero in on the functionality you’re interested in.  To see how this works, let’s use jQuery’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery\">source repo</a> as an example, and see what happens if we want to get a look at how it implements ajax.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash get jquery\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash get jquery\"><code class=\"language-bash get jquery\">❯ git clone git@github.com:jquery/jquery.git\n❯ cd jquery</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We can start by trying to get a general idea of the size of the codebase.  Running <code class=\"language-text\">ack -f</code> to show all files in the directory will immediately overrun our terminal, so we can get a file count using <code class=\"language-text\">wc</code> instead</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    249</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok thats a good amount of files.  But how many of them are actually source files?  We can filter down to just the javascript files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f --js <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    155</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>But thats probably still a bit high, since not all of the JavaScript files are source files.  A quick <code class=\"language-text\">ls</code> shows that we probably want to filter down to the src directory.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f --js src <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    92</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok so now we’re down to 92 source files.  Still a bit much, but its probably worth printing them with <code class=\"language-text\">ack -f --js src</code> at this point to get an idea of the directory structure.  When we do that, we can see there’s an ajax folder, which is probably what we’re interested in.  To make sure we’re not missing related files, we can continue on to searching for files with ajax in the file name directly.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -g --js ajax src\n    src/ajax/jsonp.js\n    src/ajax/load.js\n    src/ajax/parseJSON.js\n    src/ajax/parseXML.js\n    src/ajax/script.js\n    src/ajax/var/location.js\n    src/ajax/var/nonce.js\n    src/ajax/var/rquery.js\n    src/ajax/xhr.js\n    src/ajax.js\n    src/event/ajax.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That gets us down to 11 files to look at.  But we might be getting a bit greedy.  Not every file related to ajax may have ajax in the file path.  We can use the <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> option of ack to display the list of files that contain ajax somewhere in their text.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src\n    src/ajax/jsonp.js\n    src/ajax/load.js\n    src/ajax/script.js\n    src/ajax/xhr.js\n    src/ajax.js\n    src/event/ajax.js\n    src/jquery.js\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    src/serialize.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok that adds 3 additional files with ajax references.  But its not clear that they’re relevant to jQuery’s ajax implementation, it may just be a file reference or comment.  Lets use ack to get a quick look at how ajax is referenced in those files.  This part gets a bit more complicated.  We can use ack’s <code class=\"language-text\">-v</code> option to invert our matching and find non-matching inputs, then use unix piping to filter our previous command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>ack -v ajax\n    src/jquery.js\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    src/serialize.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Now we can use ack’s <code class=\"language-text\">-x</code> argument to search the files piped in through standard input.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src |ack -v ajax|ack -x ajax\n\n    src/jquery.js\n    20:     &quot;./ajax&quot;,\n    21:     &quot;./ajax/xhr&quot;,\n    22:     &quot;./ajax/script&quot;,\n    23:     &quot;./ajax/jsonp&quot;,\n    24:     &quot;./ajax/load&quot;,\n    25:     &quot;./event/ajax&quot;,\n\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    2:      &quot;../ajax&quot;\n    6:      return jQuery.ajax({\n    9:              // Make this explicit, since user can override this through ajaxSetup (#11264)\n\n    src/serialize.js\n    61:             traditional = jQuery.ajaxSettings &amp;&amp; jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So we can see pretty quickly that these files are safe to ignore in terms of understanding how ajax works in jQuery.  They’re just module loads, an actual call to the ajax method for other purposes, and settings serialization. It is useful to note that <code class=\"language-text\">src/ajax</code> is loaded into the main jQuery file first. Its probably worth looking at it as the starting point for our investigation. We’re well on our way to diving into the ajax functionality, able to focus on 11 of the 249 files in the repo immediately, already knowing how those files are loaded into the main library.</p>\n<p>This was just a simple example.  Whenever you’re spelunking into new code territory, consider using ack to get your bearings.  Things go a lot faster when you know the lay of the land in advance.</p>\n<h3>#3: Take advantage of Ack’s configurability</h3>\n<p>One of the nice things about <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> is the fact that it takes an <code class=\"language-text\">.ackrc</code> configuration file <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. These files can be scoped at a directory level, a user level or at a root level, and mirror the options available on the executable itself.  This allows you to extend and customize acks behavior in 3 primary ways.</p>\n<h4>a. Add new filetypes, and bundle existing ones</h4>\n<p>One of ack’s most useful features is the ability to add a <code class=\"language-text\">--&lt;filetype&gt;</code> flag to your searches to restrict your searches to a specific filetype.   ack comes with 75 builtin types including almost all common languages.  But those aren’t always good enough.  To handle obscure languages, and not so obscure syntaxes like handlebars templates, ack lets you define new filetypes.  You’re also able to modify existing filetypes to add additional file extensions to include under that filetype.  So for instance my ackrc includes these lines:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">--type-add\nhbs=hbs\n--type-add\njs=js,es6</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The first 2 lines allow me to specifically search handlebars files, which are where all of the html content for my work projects is stored.  The next 2 lines include es6 files in my JavaScript searches, useful since I append JavaScript files that I intend to process with <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> with the <code class=\"language-text\">.es6</code> extenstion.  Customizing the js extension allows me to search all of my JavaScript together.  You can also define richer types in ackrc <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/documentation/ack-2.14-man.html#defining_your_own_types\">based on file names using regular expressions or direct name matching</a>.</p>\n<h4>b. Set default options</h4>\n<p>Any option that the ack executable takes can have a default set or changed in an ackrc file.  This is mainly useful for the display option.  By default ack groups matches from different files and gives the file information above each group of matches.  It also shows all output in color.  Any of those things can be disabled or changed in your ackrc file.</p>\n<h4>c. Exclude unwanted directories or files</h4>\n<p>Oftentimes there are a predictable group of files that you may want to ignore in searches.  Perhaps you have a build directory that mirrors your source code, or documentation files mingled with your source.  You can put <code class=\"language-text\">--ignore-directory</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">--ignore-file</code>.  Ignore directory takes a directory name, while ignore-file takes matches in the same format as the custom filetypes mentioned above.</p>\n<p>If you’re starting to use ack, don’t miss the chance to make your searches even more efficient by removing any rough edges with an <code class=\"language-text\">.ackrc</code>.</p>\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/install/\">ack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing\">ag</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n    <p>\n       ack came first; ag was created as a faster version of ack.  ack is written in perl, making it more portable, and has a few more configuration options.  ag is written in C and is generally faster.

Frustrated by grep’s weird syntax or slow IDE search tools?  <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">Ack</a> is a tool like grep designed for programmers.  I use it for searching my source code to track down sections of code or look for occurences of a variable or reference.  It’s a simple open-source tool that does one job well, and does it with blazing speed.</p>\n<p>Ack performs a subset of grep’s functionality, optimizing for the programmer’s use case. In the simplest usage it will allow you to enter an expression, and will search files in the current directory/subdirectory for it, ignoring version control artifacts like .svn and .git files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># search all files in current directory recursively\n# to see if they contain &quot;foobar&quot;\nack foobar</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ack then spits out nicely formatted output with the full file paths and line numbers of each occurence.

Because of ack’s sensible defaults and focused design, these basic commands cover about 80% of what I’m looking for from a code search tool. But for those who want to do a bit more, ack can be much more powerful.  Because ack is written in perl, any perl-compatible regular expression can be used to search your files.  Ack provides plenty of options for formatting the output and it’s also very easy to filter by filetype.</p>\n<p>For instance, I have a small side project where I’m creating an event signup site with the front end code written in CoffeeScript.  If I want to see which files I’ve referenced events in without necessarily seeing all the details, I can use the <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> flag to only show file names.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-7c4ee.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 68.41379310344827%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"filenames only\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/ack_signup-60dba8e1289abe5c1cd1d144a95daad7-7c4ee.png 725w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Obviously this search brings up several types of files. Along with the CoffeeScript files I’m interested in, ack shows some html and css files, as well as a random server side file.  It also shows the generated JavaScript files.  I could get rid of these files by specifying a different root directory, but instead I’m going to show ack’s  smart filtering by filetype.  To search only coffeescript files, I just need to add the <code class=\"language-text\">--coffee</code> flag to see all CoffeeScript matches.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-bc4cb.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 42.685589519650655%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"ack filetype filtering\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-13239.png 855w,\n/static/ack_event-452a97bdd94106ace4c6ae680b2f0068-bc4cb.png 916w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Its also easy to add multiple filetype flags in order to search several filetypes, and you can even define custom filetype flags with an .ackrc file.

It’s meant to improve on grep by focusing on the programmer’s use cases, but there are <del>many</del> some situations where grep is still a good option.  Ack is situationally optimized for searching code, <del>and doesn’t work as well for filtering piped output</del>. Grep is also installed on many remote servers where you won’t have access to ack.  So ack makes a great complement to grep, moreso than a replacement.</p>\n<p><em>Update: You can totally use Ack to filter piped output.  Another reason to use grep gone.</em></p>\n<p>In terms of direct competition, <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\">ag</a> is an attempt to improve on ack, mostly in terms of speed. Ag uses various tricks to optimize speed performance for code search, using an ack compatible syntax. Since its written in C rather than perl, it is indeed significantly faster.  I personally am more comfortable with ack.  Its more mature, has better documentation, and has always been fast enough for me.</p>\n<p><del>Ag was not updated to support ack 2’s filetype filtering, and generally seems to have focused on speed over all else.</del>  It also has dependencies that I’ve found are a problem on old operating systems. Ack only depends on perl, and is thus very portable, even to Windows systems.  Still, if you find ack to be slow on your code base, or just like knowing you’re doing everything as fast as possible, ag is a great alternative.</p>\n<p><em>Update: As of version 0.22.0 ag supports ack’s filetype syntax, but does not allow you to define custom file types, a very useful ack feature.</em></p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>If you’ve been using grep or slow GUI tools to search your source code, you can do better. Ack is fast, easy to use, and optimized for programmers.  It’s also free, open-source code you can use without cost or licensing worries.  If you want to go even faster, consider using ag.  Just make sure you’re using a tool that was built for the work you’re doing.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,look-at-ack,interesting-atom","topics":["Ack","Command Line"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Ack Tips","description":"A set of tips for using Ack, a command line search tool","layout":"post","path":"/2016/04/30/ack-tips","date":"2016-04-30T15:48:25+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><em>Last summer I briefly considered creating a separate blog focused on command line tools.

If you’ve had any exposure to the command line at all, you’ve probably searched for something using grep.  grep’s standalone use is searching for content inside of files, but with Unix’s piping philosophy it is useful as a general search and filtering tool.  Originally created for Version 4 Unix 42 years ago, it has been a staple of *Nix operating systems ever since.   If you’ve been using it for even half that time, I’m sure a blog post isn’t enough to convince you to stop.

The key selling points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved speed when searching through directories</li>\n<li>Ignores version control and binary files by default when searching</li>\n<li>Easy filtering by file-type</li>\n<li>A cleaner API for searching directories, without adding complexity to the single file case</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is easiest to see by comparing commands.</p>\n<h4>Searching for “javascript” in a file</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep javascript foo.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript foo.txt</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every file in the current directory for “javascript”</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript .</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every file in the current directory for “javascript”, excluding a .git directory</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript . $(find . -type f | grep -v &#39;\\.git&#39;)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Searching every HTML file in the current directory for “javascript”, excluding a .git directory</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">grep -r javascript . $(find . -name &#39;*.html&#39; -or -name &#39;*.htm&#39;| grep -v &#39;\\.git&#39;)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ack --html javascript</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Basically, as the complexity of what you’re trying to do increases in terms of multiple files, the overhead of using grep increases proportionately.  Because ack and ag are optimized for common use cases, they’re able to scale much better.</p>\n<h3>#2: Use Ack to get familiar with a new codebase</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> is an incredibly useful tool when approaching a new codebase, especially if you’re focused on a specific feature. It allows you to quickly get a view of the codebase, and then zero in on the functionality you’re interested in.  To see how this works, let’s use jQuery’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery\">source repo</a> as an example, and see what happens if we want to get a look at how it implements ajax.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash get jquery\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash get jquery\"><code class=\"language-bash get jquery\">❯ git clone git@github.com:jquery/jquery.git\n❯ cd jquery</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We can start by trying to get a general idea of the size of the codebase.  Running <code class=\"language-text\">ack -f</code> to show all files in the directory will immediately overrun our terminal, so we can get a file count using <code class=\"language-text\">wc</code> instead</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    249</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok thats a good amount of files.  But how many of them are actually source files?  We can filter down to just the javascript files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f --js <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    155</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>But thats probably still a bit high, since not all of the JavaScript files are source files.  A quick <code class=\"language-text\">ls</code> shows that we probably want to filter down to the src directory.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -f --js src <span class=\"token operator\">|</span><span class=\"token function\">wc</span> -l\n    92</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok so now we’re down to 92 source files.  Still a bit much, but its probably worth printing them with <code class=\"language-text\">ack -f --js src</code> at this point to get an idea of the directory structure.  When we do that, we can see there’s an ajax folder, which is probably what we’re interested in.  To make sure we’re not missing related files, we can continue on to searching for files with ajax in the file name directly.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack -g --js ajax src\n    src/ajax/jsonp.js\n    src/ajax/load.js\n    src/ajax/parseJSON.js\n    src/ajax/parseXML.js\n    src/ajax/script.js\n    src/ajax/var/location.js\n    src/ajax/var/nonce.js\n    src/ajax/var/rquery.js\n    src/ajax/xhr.js\n    src/ajax.js\n    src/event/ajax.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That gets us down to 11 files to look at.  But we might be getting a bit greedy.  Not every file related to ajax may have ajax in the file path.  We can use the <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> option of ack to display the list of files that contain ajax somewhere in their text.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src\n    src/ajax/jsonp.js\n    src/ajax/load.js\n    src/ajax/script.js\n    src/ajax/xhr.js\n    src/ajax.js\n    src/event/ajax.js\n    src/jquery.js\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    src/serialize.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok that adds 3 additional files with ajax references.  But its not clear that they’re relevant to jQuery’s ajax implementation, it may just be a file reference or comment.  Lets use ack to get a quick look at how ajax is referenced in those files.  This part gets a bit more complicated.  We can use ack’s <code class=\"language-text\">-v</code> option to invert our matching and find non-matching inputs, then use unix piping to filter our previous command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>ack -v ajax\n    src/jquery.js\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    src/serialize.js</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Now we can use ack’s <code class=\"language-text\">-x</code> argument to search the files piped in through standard input.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">❯ ack --js -l ajax src |ack -v ajax|ack -x ajax\n\n    src/jquery.js\n    20:     &quot;./ajax&quot;,\n    21:     &quot;./ajax/xhr&quot;,\n    22:     &quot;./ajax/script&quot;,\n    23:     &quot;./ajax/jsonp&quot;,\n    24:     &quot;./ajax/load&quot;,\n    25:     &quot;./event/ajax&quot;,\n\n    src/manipulation/_evalUrl.js\n    2:      &quot;../ajax&quot;\n    6:      return jQuery.ajax({\n    9:              // Make this explicit, since user can override this through ajaxSetup (#11264)\n\n    src/serialize.js\n    61:             traditional = jQuery.ajaxSettings &amp;&amp; jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So we can see pretty quickly that these files are safe to ignore in terms of understanding how ajax works in jQuery.  They’re just module loads, an actual call to the ajax method for other purposes, and settings serialization. It is useful to note that <code class=\"language-text\">src/ajax</code> is loaded into the main jQuery file first. Its probably worth looking at it as the starting point for our investigation. We’re well on our way to diving into the ajax functionality, able to focus on 11 of the 249 files in the repo immediately, already knowing how those files are loaded into the main library.</p>\n<p>This was just a simple example.  Whenever you’re spelunking into new code territory, consider using ack to get your bearings.  Things go a lot faster when you know the lay of the land in advance.</p>\n<h3>#3: Take advantage of Ack’s configurability</h3>\n<p>One of the nice things about <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> is the fact that it takes an <code class=\"language-text\">.ackrc</code> configuration file <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. These files can be scoped at a directory level, a user level or at a root level, and mirror the options available on the executable itself.  This allows you to extend and customize acks behavior in 3 primary ways.</p>\n<h4>a. Add new filetypes, and bundle existing ones</h4>\n<p>One of ack’s most useful features is the ability to add a <code class=\"language-text\">--&lt;filetype&gt;</code> flag to your searches to restrict your searches to a specific filetype.   ack comes with 75 builtin types including almost all common languages.  But those aren’t always good enough.  To handle obscure languages, and not so obscure syntaxes like handlebars templates, ack lets you define new filetypes.  You’re also able to modify existing filetypes to add additional file extensions to include under that filetype.  So for instance my ackrc includes these lines:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">--type-add\nhbs=hbs\n--type-add\njs=js,es6</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The first 2 lines allow me to specifically search handlebars files, which are where all of the html content for my work projects is stored.  The next 2 lines include es6 files in my JavaScript searches, useful since I append JavaScript files that I intend to process with <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> with the <code class=\"language-text\">.es6</code> extenstion.  Customizing the js extension allows me to search all of my JavaScript together.  You can also define richer types in ackrc <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/documentation/ack-2.14-man.html#defining_your_own_types\">based on file names using regular expressions or direct name matching</a>.</p>\n<h4>b. Set default options</h4>\n<p>Any option that the ack executable takes can have a default set or changed in an ackrc file.  This is mainly useful for the display option.  By default ack groups matches from different files and gives the file information above each group of matches.  It also shows all output in color.  Any of those things can be disabled or changed in your ackrc file.</p>\n<h4>c. Exclude unwanted directories or files</h4>\n<p>Oftentimes there are a predictable group of files that you may want to ignore in searches.  Perhaps you have a build directory that mirrors your source code, or documentation files mingled with your source.  You can put <code class=\"language-text\">--ignore-directory</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">--ignore-file</code>.  Ignore directory takes a directory name, while ignore-file takes matches in the same format as the custom filetypes mentioned above.</p>\n<p>If you’re starting to use ack, don’t miss the chance to make your searches even more efficient by removing any rough edges with an <code class=\"language-text\">.ackrc</code>.</p>\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/install/\">ack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing\">ag</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n    <p>\n       ack came first; ag was created as a faster version of ack.  ack is written in perl, making it more portable, and has a few more configuration options.  ag is written in C and is generally faster.
