{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>2019 was the 6th full year of this blog, and it was a bit up and down posting wise.  For the first half of the year I published more or less a post a week, with 24 posts from January till July.  But this is only my 2nd post since then.  </p>\n<p>Turns out that starting a new job while learning to be a parent sucks up a lot of time!  I’m not making any promises for 2020, but I expect that my writing rate will fall somewhere in between the first 7 months and last 5 months of 2019.  In the meantime, here’s a brief look back at the year on the blog.</p>\n<h3>Most Read Posts Published in 2018</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/02/11/reusable-react\">Reusable Code In React: Inheritance, Composition, Decorators and Mixins</a> The most popular post for the year was also one of my favorites: a dive into the various mechanisms React provides for reusing code.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/28/readable-async\">Improving Code Readability With Async/Await</a> I really like <code class=\"language-text\">async/await</code> but its not always clear how to move older patterns to use it.  This was just a quick example of taking some ugly callback code and converting it to use async await.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/\">What’s involved in Front End Architecture?</a>\nAnother one of my favorite posts to write, this is a look at what types of things developers should be thinking about when they consider front end architecture.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2019</h3>\n<p>With all the changes, it hasn’t been a big year for experimentation, but Immer is fantastic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mweststrate/immer\">Immer</a> This probably deserves a full post at some point, but I’ve been experimenting with using only Immer and React’s built in state features for state management on a new project, and it’s been fairly nice so far.  It’s a lovely little library that makes working with immutable data pleasant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> My other big experiment on the new project has been using Storybook as a collaboration tool for our UI components.  It’s still early days, but I’m liking it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2018</h3>\n<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, lodash, MobX, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules</p>\n<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2019</h3>\n<p>I want to try building some small hardware projects and automating them this year.  Something completely different.</p>\n<h3>Blogs I started following in 2018</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://larahogan.me/\">Lara Hogan’s Engineering Leadership blog and newsletter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">Overreacted by Dan Abramov</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2018</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">Overreacted by Dan Abramov</a>, <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/\">Lara Hogan’s Engineering Leadership blog and newsletter</a>, <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/\">Rands In Repose</a>, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">Daring Fireball</a></p>\n<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2018</h3>\n<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari/Firefox, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, iMessage, Slack, Jira, 1Password, VS Code/Vim, iTerm, Fish Shell, Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear, Annotate, Dash</p>\n<h3>Best Technical Books I read in 2018</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LsAJMk\">Clean Architecture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Atomic Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EFXcVI\">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Best Non-Technical Books I read in 2018</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SfcnYP\">Radical Candor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Lscqy0\">The Tech-Wise Family</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GHNX90\">Between The World And Me</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2V7vDJU\">Vision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Bts7QM\">The Innovators</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"2019 Roundup","keywords":null,"category":"meta","date":"2019/12/30","path":"/2019-roundup","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2019-roundup"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-roundup","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2018/02/07/react-confessions/","data":{"title":"React Architecture Confessions","path":"/2018/02/07/react-confessions/","description":"The mistakes I made while learning React and why I made them","date":"2018/02/07","category":"fe-architecture"}},{"path":"/2018/07/04/evil-javascript/","data":{"title":"Evil JavaScript","path":"/2018/07/04/evil-javascript/","description":"The code you write when you don't care about people","date":"2018/07/04","category":"javascript"}},{"path":"/2018/06/05/es6-the-bad-parts/","data":{"title":"ES6: The Bad Parts","path":"/2018/06/05/es6-the-bad-parts/","description":"Three years later, what parts of ES6 have I stopped using?","date":"2018/06/05","category":"javascript"}}]}}
