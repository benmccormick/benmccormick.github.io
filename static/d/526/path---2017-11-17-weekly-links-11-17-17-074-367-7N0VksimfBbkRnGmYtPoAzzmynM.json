My favorite line: <em>‚ÄúOne of JavaScript‚Äôs best traits is how many different styles of programming it can accommodate.‚Äù</em> This is one of my favorite things about the language as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dhruvrajvanshi/thoughts-on-redux-and-its-similarities-with-oop-6d200f34656\">Thoughts on Redux and its similarities with OOP | Dhruv Rajvanshi</a> - I always find it useful to understand when core concepts are shared across very different looking tools and paradigms</p>\n<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/\">Entering the Quantum Era‚ÄîHow Firefox got fast again and where it‚Äôs going to get faster | Lin Clark</a> - I‚Äôve been using Firefox 57 as my primary browser this week and so far it is very very nice.  Other than a single Chrome-specific extension that I‚Äôm missing, and a few minor devtool annoyances, everything has worked great.  And it is blazing fast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share\">Introducing Visual Studio Live Share | Microsoft</a> and\n<a href=\"https://blog.atom.io/2017/11/15/code-together-in-real-time-with-teletype-for-atom.html\">Code together in real time with Teletype for Atom | Github</a>  - In what appears to be a crazy coincidence, both Atom and Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code announced new tools for collaborating with other developers on code, using a google docs-like experience.  Atom‚Äôs solution is available in beta today, and is a free WebRTC based peer-to-peer solution for editing code together, with the primary user sharing their active tab with anybody who has the uniqueID for your session.  It also includes open-sourcing a library that would let other editors implement its document protocol. Microsoft‚Äôs solution is more ambitious, supporting both Visual Studio and Visual Studio code, and allowing users access to a whole shared workspace.  It is just an announcement for now though, and it‚Äôs not clear if it is a peer to peer or centralized solution, nor whether it will have a cost associated with it.  Regardless, both solutions look amazingly cool.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As one of the three engineers that built Teletype, I share your curiosity! üôà</p>&mdash; Jason Rudolph (@jasonrudolph) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/930856578915344384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2AVaAjx\">Managing Humans | Michael Lopp (AKA Rands)</a> - This book was a great roundup of some of the best writings from one of my favorite blogs <a href=\"http://randsinrepose.com/\">Rands in Repose</a>.
