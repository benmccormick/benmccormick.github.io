{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://stateofjs.com/\">The State Of JavaScript 2017</a> - This annual survey of JavaScript developers always has lots of interesting insights.  Since it is an internet survey, I view it less as a full snapshot of the industry, but more as a place to see what is new and trending in the JS world.  This year <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> and <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> caught my eye as spiking in popularity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/12/the-glimmer-binary-experience\">The Glimmer Binary Experience | LinkedIn Engineering</a> - I had the privilege of seeing Yehuda Katz, one of the Ember core developers, give a talk about <a href=\"https://glimmerjs.com/\">Glimmer</a> and bytecode at this year’s All Things Open conference.  They’re doing some pretty serious software engineering in the Ember community right now.  This write-up covers a lot of the same ground and is worth a read.</p>\n<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.atom.io/2017/12/12/atom-1-23.html\">Atom 1.23</a> and <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_19\">Visual Studio Code 1.19</a> were released this week, making this a big week for Electron based text editors.  If you use either of them, you’ll get to enjoy a nice set of performance improvements when you upgrade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.bear-writer.com/bear-1-4-the-tags-edition-298d6fdc55dd\">Bear 1.4</a> - Speaking of software that I love to use getting updates, I’ve been using Bear as my primary notes app for the last year, and it is a delight.  Getting autocomplete on tags this week solved it’s last real annoyance for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a simple notes app.  It’s more powerful than Apple’s notes or text files, but cleaner and more elegant than <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a>.  And even the paid level is very affordable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: December 15th 2017","keywords":"javascript glimmer atom visual studio code bear","category":"opinion","date":"2017/12/15","path":"/2017/12/15/weekly-links-12-15-17/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2017/12/15/weekly-links-12-15-17/"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"2017-12-15-weekly-links-12-15-17-388","internalComponentName":"Component20171215WeeklyLinks121517","path":"/2017/12/15/weekly-links-12-15-17/","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/2017/12/15/weekly-links-12-15-17/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]},"updatedAt":1530367676680,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/2017/12/15/weekly-links-12-15-17/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}}]}}
