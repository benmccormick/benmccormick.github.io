{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hi, I’m Ben McCormick.  I’m a web developer, writer, occasional athlete, and a Christian. This is my blog about JavaScript, the Web and development tools.</p>\n<p>I live in Durham NC with my wife Claire and our dog Samoa, and prior to that I grew up in Pittsburgh.  I have plenty of pride in both of my homes.  When I’m not writing code or text, you can find me playing basketball, ultimate frisbee, and board games, relaxing with my wife, or volunteering at my church.  I currently work at <a href=\"http://www.windsorcircle.com\">Windsor Circle</a>, and spend my days there writing a lot of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>If you have thoughts about the blog or want to contact me about related opportunities by email at ben AT benmccormick.org.</p>\n<h3>Blog Bookkeeping</h3>\n<p>benmccormick.org is run on top of the <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> using <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\">Gatsby</a>.  I occasionally link to various books and services when I blog.  These links are often affiliate links, for which I receive a small commission on sales.
