No features have been confirmed yet, but worth a bookmark.  He also has links to his detailed articles about the various candidate features if you’re interested in seeing where JavaScript is headed next.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-javascript-supply-chain-paradox-sri-csp-and-trust-in-third-party-libraries/\">The JavaScript Supply Chain Paradox: SRI, CSP and Trust in Third Party Libraries | Troy Hunt</a> - This is a great reminder on why including scripts from 3rd party domains is a risky business, and how to do it securely.</p>\n<h4>Computer Science</h4>\n<p>After my <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/\">post on Computer Science</a> this week, I thought I’d share 2 CS-y links I came across this week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401\">How to think in graphs: an illustrative introduction to Graph Theory and its applications | Vardan Grigoryan</a> -  This is a nice “plain language” explanation of basic graph theory.  It’s a bit long, but it’s a nice thing to look at for the folks who told me this week they want to know more about data structures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2BL3YHo\">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns | Addy Osmani</a> - One of the better “CS for front end” resources I’m aware of is Addy Osmani’s book on JavaScript design patterns.  Like a lot of things in JS land, parts of it haven’t aged well now that it’s a 6 year old book (it’s very focused on jQuery and DOM manipulation in many of its examples), but since it’s centered around more timeless design patterns, I think it holds up well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: February 23rd","keywords":"computer science scripts es2019","category":"opinion","date":"2018/02/23","path":"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"2018-02-23-weekly-links-02-23-18-fd9","internalComponentName":"Component20180223WeeklyLinks022318","path":"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/09/19/the-iphone-5-conversation-so-far","data":{"title":"The iPhone 5 Conversation so Far","path":"/2012/09/19/the-iphone-5-conversation-so-far","description":"The same conversation just keeps happening","date":"2012-09-19T11:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2013/06/09/90-done-halfway-there","data":{"title":"90% Done, Halfway There","path":"/2013/06/09/90-done-halfway-there","description":"A post on the difficulties of estimating development projects","date":"2013-06-09T18:45:00+00:00"}}]},"updatedAt":1531140554559,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/2018/02/23/weekly-links-02-23-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2012/09/19/the-iphone-5-conversation-so-far","data":{"title":"The iPhone 5 Conversation so Far","path":"/2012/09/19/the-iphone-5-conversation-so-far","description":"The same conversation just keeps happening","date":"2012-09-19T11:00:00+00:00"}},{"path":"/2013/06/09/90-done-halfway-there","data":{"title":"90% Done, Halfway There","path":"/2013/06/09/90-done-halfway-there","description":"A post on the difficulties of estimating development projects","date":"2013-06-09T18:45:00+00:00"}}]}}
