That’s just a joke.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Somewhat Open","keywords":null,"category":"opinion","date":"2013-08-15T16:15:00+00:00","path":"/2013/08/15/somewhat-open","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2013/08/15/somewhat-open"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/08/15/somewhat-open","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2013/06/08/customer-culture-revisited","data":{"title":"Customer Culture Revisited","path":"/2013/06/08/customer-culture-revisited","description":"Talking about how Microsoft culture impacts their products","date":"2013-06-08T18:45:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2013/08/15/somewhat-open","data":{"title":"Somewhat Open","path":"/2013/08/15/somewhat-open","description":"What is an open API?","date":"2013-08-15T16:15:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2017/11/10/friday-links/","data":{"title":"Weekly Links: November 10th 2017","path":"/2017/11/10/friday-links/","description":"React, Social Media, and Comments","date":"2017/11/10","category":"opinion"}}]}}
