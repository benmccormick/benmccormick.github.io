I’ve found that I enjoy this teaching style, I also loved <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KHf3Ps\">Death By Meeting</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2KXOkxh\">The Goal</a>, which employee the same style.  The beauty of fables is the way they allow you to soak into a scenario, and connect it to your own experiences and relationships.  Then as the principles the author wants to teach unfold, they take advantage of those connections to spark ideas for application.  At least that’s the theory.</p>\n<p>The Five Dysfunctions is of course, about how teams go wrong.  I won’t spoil the contents too much, but ultimately, team failures aren’t about technique or distinct decisions, but human beings and how we relate to each other.  This book both clearly defines a set of those problems, and then gives concrete suggestions for improving a team when they’re present.  It’s a classic, and I found it as thought provoking as I expected.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to better understand how teams work, and how they fail.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2018/07/09/book-review-five-dysfunctions/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"utility-functions,reusable-react,book-review-five-dysfunctions","topics":["Management","Leadership"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"consistency","title":"Consistency","description":"How do we encourage standards in a code base without losing perspective?","layout":"post","path":"/2019/04/01/consistency","date":"2019/04/01","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>The last few weeks I’ve had several conversations with a coworker about consistency in code: why do we do things one way here, and a different way there?  Some of this is macro level; Where do we split chunks of related functionality into different files?  Some of it is micro level; what should the rules be for when we use an inline function instead of pulling it out into its own named method?  Some of it is trivial; Do we use <code class=\"language-text\">_</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">-</code> to separate words in file names?  In our current codebase we’re not always consistent on many of these issues.  As we’ve discussed the various issues, I realized that some of them bothered me more than others, and (more interestingly to me) my ideas have changed here over time.</p>\n<h3>The Platonic Ideal</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p> In a perfectly consistent system, 3 developers writing the same module would produce line by line identical code</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s an extreme point of view out there that says “while a perfectly consistent system might not be possible, the closer we can get to that the better”.  The benefits of consistency are many: consistent naming helps with code search and connecting different parts of a system.  Consistent code structure makes code easier to scan once a developer is familiar with the system, and it makes exceptions stand out as something intentional and interesting.  Consistent formatting removes potential distractions.   So what’s not to love?  Shouldn’t we always try to add more consistency?  I see 2 primary reasons why it might not be worth trying to enforce every single rule we can come up with.</p>\n<h4>We’re only human</h4>\n<p>The first reason not to enforce “everything” is that our human attention spans can only internalize so many rules at once.  When we’re trying to remember a large number of rules, its easy to miss one.  But more importantly, when we’re writing code or reviewing it, focusing too much on human enforced consistency rules can distract from the actual purpose of the code, making it harder to notice the substance of code because we’re so focused on the form.</p>\n<h4>Standards too soon</h4>\n<p>The other thing that can happen when you try to standardize everything is a loss of creativity.  Sometimes it’s helpful to experiment for a while to find the right pattern in a codebase.  In an ideal situation experiments like that will happen on the side, or be explored in branches, but for small teams or new codebases, it will likely happen at least partially in production.</p>\n<h3>User Friendly Consistency</h3>\n<p>So what <strong>can</strong> we do to get the benefits of consistency? The 4 ways I like to see this happen are:</p>\n<h4>Automation</h4>\n<p>The best way to enforce stylistic consistency and other straightforward things like naming conventions is to use automation.  Linters like <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> and auto-formatters like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>.  My rule here is that any linter rule that is about stylistic consistency should be auto-fixable, if not it isn’t clear enough or isn’t worth it.  For “correctness rules” it can be ok to flag errors without auto-fixing, if human judgement is needed.</p>\n<h4>Code Review Checklists</h4>\n<p>Code reviews can be a good way to limitedly enforce consistency; but its good to limit scope to avoid <a href=\"https://samsaccone.com/posts/code-reviews-not-nits.html\">developers trying to become human compilers</a>.  If you try to enforce too many things in code reviews, its easy for people to get caught up in going through a list and forget to apply human judgement to the context of the current code. But <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews\">code review checklists</a> are a good way to make a coordinated push on high value items that are either new or often neglected.  This checklist should consist of a few important things to check during every review. The list should be re-examined on a regular basis and ideally kept to 5 or less items.</p>\n<h4>Focused Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Sometimes its appropriate to have “refactoring initiatives” to standardize on a particular pattern over time.  This can be good for standardizing on a particular library for a task, or removing an older pattern that persists in the codebase after a better way has been found.  My advice here is to <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/\">only do one of these at a time, and complete them before starting a new one</a>.  One of the biggest causes of inconsistency is when a team attempts to ”<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">standardize</a>” on a solution, then abandons that for a new solution without finish the migration, resulting in a <a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html\">lava layer architecture</a>.</p>\n<h4>Focus on the high level</h4>\n<p>If there is one place to apply human consistency checks its at the structural level.  If your high level patterns are consistent, the code base will be easy to navigate, and modular code written in a standardized high level structure will be <a href=\"https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to\">easy to delete</a>.  Overall low level code that is inconsistent or poorly written is easier to overcome than high level code as long as you’re taking advantage of code reviews and the other methods suggested here to improve new code, because most low level code is only read occasionally.  So high traffic “messy code” can be a focus of refactoring efforts, and the rest can continue working without disturbing anything.</p>\n<p>Messy code is much more problematic at a structural level though, because when different areas of the code are arranged in different ways, it becomes much harder to find functionality when debugging.  This type of inconsistency also tends to make bulk improvements harder, as you have to have a much greater understanding of all the ways a codebase is put together.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/04/01/consistency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"radical-candor-book,clean-architecture-book,tech-leads-book","topics":["Leadership","Book Review"],"category":"reviews","key":"resilient-management-book","title":"Book Review: Resilient Management","description":"A great collection of management wisdom","layout":"review","path":"/2019/07/22/book-review-resilient-management","date":"2019/07/22","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management\">Resilient Management</a> by Lara Hogan is a short and useful read for engineering managers who want to think more systematically about how they support their team.

This is a <em>blog+</em> book: most of the material here has appeared previously in Lara’s blog or newsletter, but for the book it has been cleaned up and organized together in a coherent fashion that makes it greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>If you’ve followed my <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/subscribe\">newsletter</a> for a while, you’ll have seen me link to Lara’s work on a regular basis.  Lara’s strength as a teacher is building meaningful exercises for thinking through abstract topics, and that plays out here.  Almost every piece of advice and insight comes with a suggestion on how to start implementing it, or an exercise to help you think deeper about yourself or your situation.  I’ve found her <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/leadership-style-colors/\">leadership colors</a> and her <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/team-introspection/\">MadLibs worksheet for leadership philosophy</a> particularly helpful for me.</p>\n<p>In addition to the helpful exercises, the highlights of the book for me were Lara’s look at the BICEPS model for understanding people’s needs at work, the way she structured her book around a groups evolution over time, and the chapter on communication plans.  I’ve made notes to reference each of those areas the next time I hit a relevant situation.</p>\n<p>Overall I’d recommend this book to pretty much any early-career engineering manager.  If you’re not already familiar with Lara’s work, there should be some fantastic new ideas for you in here.  If you have followed it, I recommend buying out of appreciation, and to get the concepts bundled in a nice cleanly organized packages.

People who don’t care about those they work with and also don’t challenge them fall into manipulative insincerity and should be avoided at all costs.  The Steve Jobsian category of Obnoxious Aggression is when somebody is willing to challenge directly but doesn’t care about the people they’re challengin. To Scott’s mind, Obnoxious Aggression is preferred over Ruinous Empathy; when people who hate the idea of hurting somebody so much that they fail to tell them important truths.  But the target quadrant is Radical Candor, a state where you deal with people in a way that is backed by real humanity while still being willing to be exceptionally honest and challenging.</p>\n<p>This core idea wasn’t super new to me, I had seen it formulated in Church contexts as <code class=\"language-text\">Grace + Truth = Growth</code> in the past.

That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>\n<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>\n<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>\n<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>\n<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>\n<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>\n<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>\n<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>\n<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>\n<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>\n<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>\n<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> and <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod\">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/\">pre-commit hooks</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>\n<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>\n<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>\n<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>\n<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/\">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I’ve gotten to work with plenty of non-devs who respect the need for good architecture.

Time discipline is key</h4>\n<p>The biggest challenge of this transition was learning to be a manager.  It’s a whole new job!  But the biggest challenge specific to the management/developer split has been managing my time.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit loose with my time management.  I do a lot based on my mental state at a particular time; if I’m tired or uninspired I may lean more into grunt work like documentation, code reviews, or more “scripted” code work.  If I’m in the zone I’ll dive into big tasks, and if someone comes to me with a problem I tend to context shift into it and go from there.</p>\n<p>This “time management strategy” hasn’t held up at all while trying to balance manager and development strategies.  Basically because of the blend of <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">maker and manager schedules</a>.  Developers need long uninterrupted periods of time to be productive, while managers tend to operate on a much more social and interrupt driven schedule.  They’re naturally opposed.</p>\n<p>Working with this tension requires discipline and planning.  For me personally I’ve started planning my schedule for the next day at the end of the previous day, batching my checking of Slack/email and being more thoughtful when somebody asks for my time.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning my schedule for the next day</strong> is a tip I picked up from <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule\">Deep Work</a>.  To close out the day, I review the things I’ll need to handle the next day, and block out my calendar with time for different tasks for the next day.  This does mean that my calendar <em>always looks completely booked for the current day</em>.  So far this has served as a feature not a bug; I can still move things if something urgent comes up and it has a way of encouraging people to schedule less urgent things in advance.  Note that scheduling like this doesn’t mean you can’t change plans; I do all the time.  It just means that you start with a plan and can be thoughtful about how you vary off of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Batching Slack and email</strong> has been something I’ve known would be good for me forever.  It feels good in the moment to be the guy who is constantly available, but the cost of distraction is higher than you think.  So far, management has been a catalyst for me buckling down here.</p>\n<p>Finally, I get a lot more unexpected requests for my time now than I did previously.  I’ve found that batching my email and Slack reading combined with <strong>a willingness to suggest a meeting later in the day or the next morning rather than <em>right now</em></strong> has helped me protect blocks of productivity and focus, without making me an unresponsive manager.  Most things can sit for 2 hours without blowing up anyone’s day.  The key is to ask enough to identify the 5% of things that can’t wait.</p>\n<p>Those 3 tactics have worked for me, but overall it comes down to being intentional about your time.  If you let yourself be blown by the wind while splitting dual responsibilities, one of them will almost always receive the short end of the stick.</p>\n<h4>2. Team success metrics are the only ones that matter</h4>\n<p>When you’re acting as both a developer and a manager, it can be tempting to hold yourselves to 2 sets of metrics: management metrics and development metrics.  This is a mistake.  It will cause you to over-prioritize your own tasks and hurt your team’s long term growth.</p>\n<p>Focusing on personal development metrics and goals can lead to over-prioritizing them for a few reasons. First, development goals tend to be much “cleaner” than management goals; it’s easier to tell what you’ve achieved.  Second, if you’re transitioning into this role from a dev role, you probably are much more comfortable with these tasks, and so they can act as a safe place where you avoid having to stretch yourself.  And finally, if you moved into this role from a senior dev position, it can be easy to tell yourself that this is actually the best way to get stuff done.  And you may be right… in the short term.</p>\n<p>So what’s the antidote?  Focus on team productivity and view your own work as just an extra card you have to play in your hand.  It’s an advantage you have over less technical managers, but if you don’t set to working developing other strengths, you’re not going to be able to grow, and if you’re monopolizing the important work your team won’t be able to step up into new roles.  So play that card, but do it with caution, and always as a means rather than an end.</p>\n<h4>3. This isn’t long term sustainable; have a plan</h4>\n<p>Hybrid Management / Developer roles aren’t a long term game.  Aside from the scheduling tension I mentioned above, once you move into this role you’re either going to be slowly giving up responsibilities and watching your tech skills slowly move off the cutting edge as you focus on learning how to manager your team and developing others to fill the roles you once did, or you’re going to be failing as a manager as you try to cling too tightly to your senior individual contributor responsibilities.  So if you want to avoid that, it’s important to be evaluating how you want your career to evolve.  A role like this can be a first step up a chain, or part of a <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">dev to manager pendulum</a>.  You also might discover that management isn’t for you and decide to move back.  I’m committed to this for a set period of time, and that’s helped me to work through the days when I wonder what I actually accomplished, and think strategically about what I need to get better at.</p>\n<h4>4. Best Management resources</h4>\n<p>So this isn’t a learning so much, but as a newbie manager, probably the best thing I can do is point you to the resources I’ve found helpful.
