{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><em>A member of my team at work asked me last week how I continue to learn things about JavaScript.  This is my answer. Note that it is focused on leveling up for folks with existing programming experience, not giving the best pathway into the field.</em></p>\n<p>I’m going to break this up into 4 parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The different ways people tackle learning new programming things</li>\n<li>The types of knowledge you might want to acquire while learning</li>\n<li>An inventory of the different types of resources out there for learning programming</li>\n<li>My specific recommendations for JavaScript and React resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first 3 are going to be generalizable to any type of learning about programming you want to pursue (and probably other fields as well).  The last one is necessarily more specific.</p>\n<h4>Learning Strategies</h4>\n<p>It’s helpful to start by talking about the different ways that people learn programming concepts.  We can break things up into 3 categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practical</strong>:  This is where you work on projects and pursue goals, and learn the things you need as you need them.</li>\n<li><strong>Topical</strong>: This is when you commit to learning something about a certain set of topics that you think will be valuable.  This may be related to work you’re doing, but your goal is a deep understanding of the topic moreso than trying to solve a specific problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Serendipitous</strong>: This type of learning isn’t directed at all.  You’re just diving into learning as you encounter new terms or concepts, trying to absorb and understand everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So which one is best?  You’ll hear arguments for all three, but personally I see learning like investing; it’s a long term game that you can’t win in a day, the gains accumulate slowly until suddenly you’re a long way from where you started, and one of the keys is diversifying.</p>\n<p>Practical knowledge is safe; when you focus on learning things you need, you’ll rarely waste your time, will likely get more done, and will put yourself in a position to learn more interesting things as you develop a reputation for doing good work.  However focusing solely on learning the things you need to do your current job may blind you to trends and eventually leave you with an out of date skill set. In addition, while you may be looking for answers to practical problems, if your knowledge base is narrow to start you may miss out on innovative ideas because you don’t have exposure to solutions that might not “google well” for the way you think of your current needs.</p>\n<p>Topical knowledge can be very useful when jumping into a new area of work: sometimes you just need a level of exposure to the syntax, concepts and tools behind a language, framework or project before you can effectively work with it.  But learning about a topic divorced from a project can sometimes feel more productive in the moment than it actually ends up being: without practical experience of the pain points that the topic is solving for and/or causing, it can be hard to know what is important and make the connections that you really need. Topical learning can also devolve into a purely academic exercise where you never really learn to apply what you know.</p>\n<p>Serendipitous learning on the face of it is the most easily wasted; trying to learn everything can be overwhelming in programming, a field based on layers of abstractions, with a plethora of different subfields that can be explored for years without learning everything. However sometimes it is the dash of inspiration that comes from bringing previously disconnected ideas together that leads to the creation of something novel and great.  And those types of connection only come from somebody who is learning broadly as well as deeply.  Being curious also prevents the pitfalls of purely practical learning: dead-ends and blind spots. So there is a place for serendipitous learning too.</p>\n<p>The best approach is a mix of the 3: have real problems that you’re trying to solve, but make sure to keep an eye out for interesting things, and don’t be afraid of the occasional deep dive into a useful sounding topic.</p>\n<h3>Resource Types</h3>\n<p>There are so many ways to learn things in the programming world.  Below is a brief roundup of resource types, ordered roughly in terms of stability and how rapidly things change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Courses</strong> - College, bootcamps, Coursera, etc:  These are the ultimate in topical learning.  Not something that most people are doing every day, but can be great for rebooting a career if you want to head in a new direction or refresh after being away from the field for a while.</li>\n<li><strong>Books</strong> - People are still writing programming books.  These tend to fall into 2 categories: books about a specific framework or technique and more “timeless” books about some fundamental part of how we write software. The first group tends. to age fast but can be great for topical learning, the second are an essential resource for “higher level” thinking about our field.</li>\n<li>Video Courses</li>\n<li>Wikis</li>\n<li>Blogs</li>\n<li>Podcasts</li>\n<li>Newsletters</li>\n<li>Github/Looking at code</li>\n<li>Forums</li>\n<li>Conferences</li>\n<li>Aggregators + Meetup</li>\n<li>Social Media</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Specific Resources</h1>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Philosophy of Software Design</li>\n<li>JavaScript Allongé</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Video Courses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Egghead.io</li>\n<li>Wes Bos (note second hand)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wikis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stack Overflow</li>\n<li>MDN</li>\n<li>Wikipedia</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Blogs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Overreacted</li>\n<li>CSS Tricks</li>\n<li>React Blog</li>\n<li>2ality</li>\n<li>Mine?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Newsletter</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>JS Weekly (maybe mention React status)</li>\n<li>PonyFoo</li>\n<li>Kent C Dodds</li>\n<li>Hacker Newsletter</li>\n<li>React Weekly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aggregators</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Keep Learning JavaScript","keywords":"javascript learning newsletters blogs rss twitter","category":"software-productivity","date":"2019/02/18","path":"/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js","layout":"post","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/02/18/how-to-keep-learning-js","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/","data":{"title":"How to follow the JavaScript roadmap","path":"/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/","description":"Keeping up with the language's progress","date":"2017-07-10T12:00:00+00:00","category":"javascript"}},{"path":"/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/","data":{"title":"What's involved in Front End Architecture?","path":"/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/","description":"6 areas of interest in front end software design discussions","date":"2019/01/07","category":"fe-architecture"}},{"path":"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/","data":{"title":"Ten Things A Serious JavaScript Developer Should Learn","path":"/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/","description":"Some of the important things to pick up in the JS world","date":"2017-07-19T04:00:00+00:00","category":"javascript"}}]}}
