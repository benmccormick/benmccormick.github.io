I’m going to limit myself to listing 5 of the most useful for Javascript development, but its definitely worth looking around at the options to find more that fit what you want to do.</p>\n<h3>#1. Package Control - The Essential Plugin</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\">Package Control</a> is the very first package anyone should install for Sublime Text.  It makes it easy to install any other package without having to clone Git repositories or work through Sublimes file structure.  And the author has made it relatively easy to install Package control as well.  All that is required is a quick copy and paste of code provided on the developers website.  Package control makes it easy to install new packages, snippets, themes, and color schemes.</p>\n<h3>#2. Sublime Linter - Write Better Code</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter\">Sublime Linter</a> is a code quality tool for Sublime Text that makes it easy to find and fix code that doesn’t meet the standards that you define.  For javascript code you can choose to use jsHint<a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/\">jshint</a> or jsLint<a href=\"http://www.jslint.com/\">jslint</a>, the two most popular javascript linters.  I highly recommend this package.  It places a border around lines that are non-conformant with a message in the bottom border of the editor, but otherwise stays out of your way.  It makes it easy to fix code issues as you’re editing, rather than waiting till the end and getting a huge error dump when you run your code through the linter.</p>\n<h3>#3. Emmet - Get Through The Boilerplate</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.emmet.io/\">Emmet</a> is a tool for web developers that allows you to use CSS style prefixes to quickly generate html code.  It allows quick generation of boilerplate HTML with a familiar syntax, so you can focus on code instead of markup.  The github project for the package is <a href=\"https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime\">here</a></p>\n<h3>#4. Git - Take Control Of Your Project Inside Your Editor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> has rapidly become the go to version control system for open-source projects, and is also used by many private organizations and individual developers.  If you’re using Git to manage your javascript projects, you should definitely install the <a href=\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki\">git package</a> for Sublime Text.  Its not a command line replacement, some commands move much slower than it would with command line, but it allows the convenience of using common commands like add, diff, and blame from within your editor.</p>\n<h3>#5. Clipboard History - Improve your clipboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-clipboard-history\">Clipboard History</a>  is a nice little utility that lets you see the recent history of your clipboard.  It only works for snippets copied from within Sublime Text, but its a nice little tool for refactoring, when you’re moving code around quickly and want to delete something without losing it completely.</p>\n<h3>Find your own</h3>\n<p>In the end different packages work for different people.  I highly recommend installing Package Control and browsing around through the options.  If you find a great package, leave a comment here and let me know.  There are a lot of packages out there, and everybody’s needs are different</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/03/sublime-text-for-javascript-plugins"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-art","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":"vim-language","title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language","description":"An explanation of the grammar behind Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","date":"2014-07-02T11:27:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if your text editor just did what you said instead of making you slowly and manually add and delete characters?  Vim doesn’t speak English, but it has a language of its own, built out of composable commands, that is much more efficient than the simple movement and editing commands you’ll find in other editors.  In my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">last post</a>, I took an initial look at Vim as a language.  I’m going to dive deeper into that here.</p>\n<h3>Vim Verbs: What can you do?</h3>\n<p>Vim’s “verbs” mostly fall into 2 main categories.  Some of them act on a single character, and others act on a “motion” or “text object”.  We’ll look at motions in a second, but lets start by looking at the verbs.</p>\n<h4>Single character verbs</h4>\n<p>So like I said, there are a few vim actions that act on a single character.  They act as shortcuts for actions that you can also perform with motions, and allow you to save a few keystrokes.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>Delete character under the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>r</td><td>Replace character under cursor with another character</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>s</td><td>Delete character under cursor and move to insert mode</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These are great commands to know, and things that I use daily, but they act as a bit of an island.  Let’s look at some verbs with more power.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>d<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>c<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion and go into insert mode</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>y<motion></td><td>Yank (copy) text specified by motion</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These aren’t the only 3 actions that you can use with motions, but they’re probably the most important. The first 2 are roughly the same as deleting or cutting in most instances, with the option to choose what mode you end in. The 3rd is Vim’s version of copying.</p>\n<h4>Motions</h4>\n<p>So how do we use these actions?  You’ll notice that if you type any of the above characters into Vim by themselves, nothing happens.  That’s because they’re expecting something to act on.  If you’re a grammar nerd or remember your 8th grade english classes, you can think of these as transitive verbs that need to act on a direct object.  These “direct objects” come in 2 forms, motions and text objects.  Motions are the motion commands that you can use at any time to move around Vim.  Some examples:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Motion</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the line</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>G<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the file</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>f.<motion></td><td>Go to the next occurrence of `.` on the current line</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>All of these commands work as motions on their own, but when you combine them with actions you can get powerful effects.  So <code class=\"language-text\">d$</code> means “delete to the end of the line”.  <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> means “change through the next closing parentheses” and <code class=\"language-text\">yG</code> means copy everything through the end of the file.  The list above is only a small subset of the motions available.  I’d suggest learning 1 or 2 to start and using them when appropriate.  As you get more comfortable with Vim you can continue to add more, and each one will unlock a set of commands for all of the actions you know.</p>\n<p>The second type of “direct object” that Vim verbs can take is a text object.  You can think of text objects as a “defined chunk of text.”  Some examples include selecting words, html tag contents, or the contents of a function.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Text Object</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iw</td><td>Applies to everything in the current word</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>it<motion></td><td>Applies to everything in current xml/html tag</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>i{<motion></td><td>Applies to everything inside nearest curly brackets</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>So using text objects you can change the contents of a word with the easily memorizable <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> (change in word), or copy the contents of an html <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with yit.  It’s worth mentioning here that one of the most powerful text objects is a bit of an oddball.  A really common thing people do is applying an action to the current line.  Vi’s language makes this easy by allowing the shortcut for this text object to be a simple repeat of the action.  So <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> yanks the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> deletes it, and <code class=\"language-text\">cc</code> changes it.</p>\n<h4>Piece by Piece</h4>\n<p>The key here is that learning Vim isn’t something you do in a weekend. It’s an iterative process. Since the actions, motions, and text objects build on themselves, you can start to grow your toolbox exponentially as time goes on.  But you’ll want to start with a few commands that you find make you productive.  I’ve personally found <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ci(</code> to be incredibly useful commands, and a great place to start as you learn to use these commands instead of the slower “mouse and select” methods that you may be used to. When we learn languages we all start with basic sentences, learn the grammar rules and grow from there.  Vim is no different. Start small and add to your toolbox as you build great things with it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/1424361\">Your problem with Vim is that you don’t grok vi</a> - A concise explanation of what makes vi/vim special, and one of the most popular answers ever on Stack Overflow.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1\">Why Atom can’t replace Vim</a> - A great piece on the big picture importance of composable commands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/\">Vim Text Objects: The Definitive Guide</a> - This is a nice rundown of the different text objects available, including some that you can add using plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Update</h4>\n<p>This post is currently on the front page of Hacker News.

I don’t completely love it.  There are elements (startup speed, maturity of some core editing components, not being able to run it in a terminal) that I miss from my experiences with Vim and/or Sublime Text.  I’m using Atom though because the core editing experience is now “good enough” and the way the editor is built allows for some very cool and unique experiences.  Atom (like <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>) is built on <a href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\">Electron</a>, Github’s JavaScript environment for building desktop apps.  Because it is built with web technologies and was designed from the beginning to be extensible, it is much easier for most developers to build rich visual extensions on top of Atom that provide unique UIs for editor functions than it is in Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs or an IDE.  The following are some of the “most interesting” Atom packages I’ve found.  Interesting in this case means that they really only could have been done as they are in Atom or a similarly flexible editor.</p>\n<h3>Pigments</h3>\n<p>At first use, <a href=\"https://github.com/abe33/atom-pigments\">Pigments</a> seems like a pretty run of the mill color highlighter.

Because Atom itself is made up of packages, with a very small core package, it’s easy to replace key parts of the editor like the auto-complete package with a community version.

But rather than being limited to the line-by-line gutter warnings or showing collections of warnings through awkward use of UI elements meant for a different purpose, Linter shows you a live collection of errors at the bottom of the file and lets you easily switch back and forth between that and errors for all open project files.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-4d321.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 97.26027397260275%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"linter\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-13239.png 855w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-4d321.png 1606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h3>git-time-machine</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/littlebee/git-time-machine\">git-time-machine</a> is the newest package on this list.

I’ve been using it as my primary editor for a year and a half, and have picked up some tips along the way that I thought were worth sharing.  These tips assume that you have at least a passing familiarity with Atom: they’re the things that I’ve picked up over time that have made me more productive.</p>\n<h4>1. There is more to the Fuzzy Finder than meets the eye</h4>\n<p>Fuzzy finders have been a key feature on modern editors since TextMate first popularized the ⌘T command<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> for searching through project files.  ⌘T (or ⌘P) still works great in Atom, but what you may not know is that Atom provides 2 other versions of the command. ⌘B searches only among currently open files.  ⇧⌘B searches only among files that are “dirty” according to git<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  Both of those options are built in.  You can also find other uses for the fuzzy-finder if you start exploring plugins, including <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-fuzzy-grep\">atom-fuzzy-grep</a>, a plugin that lets you use the fuzzy-finder interface to search file contents using grep, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2016/04/30/ack-tips/\">ack</a>, ag, or ripgrep.</p>\n<h4>2. Atom is a great Vim replacement</h4>\n<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you know I’ve written a lot about <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">Vim</a>.  I still love the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">philosophy of Vim</a>, and think that the text editing <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language</a> it implements is the best way to edit code quickly.  But Atom’s <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus\">vim-mode-plus</a> is the best vi implementation I’ve seen outside of Vim, and unlike other editors, you don’t need to get frustrated with a halfway approach to Vi-keybindings, since you can make pretty much everything work in a vim-like way.  That’s because:</p>\n<h4>3. Atom’s keybindings are powerful and flexible</h4>\n<p>Any command exposed by the core editor or a plugin in Atom can be bound to a keyboard shortcut.  None of the default commands are hard-coded, and the editor provides powerful contexts for controlling what keys have lead to what action when.  That means if I want to use <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j/k/l/h</code> to control my navigation between split panes, but also use <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j/k</code> to move up and down in the autocomplete widget, I can just add these lines to my <code class=\"language-text\">keymap.cson</code> file</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token string\">'atom-text-editor, body'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-k'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-above'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-j'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-below'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-h'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-on-left'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-l'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-on-right'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token string\">'body atom-text-editor.autocomplete-active'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-k'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'autocomplete-plus:move-up'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-j'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'autocomplete-plus:move-down'</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Different commands are triggered in different context.  You can also take advantage of this with vim-mode to have “normal mode only” keyboard shortcuts like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token string\">'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus.normal-mode'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'] b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'pane:show-next-item'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'[ b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'pane:show-previous-item'</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That implements a behavior I’d missed from Vim’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired\">unimpaired plugin</a> of moving between open files with <code class=\"language-text\">[b</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">]b</code>.</p>\n<h4>4. Make sure to sync your settings</h4>\n<p>One area where Atom is less ideal than Vim is setting portability.  It doesn’t have a single file where all configuration is stored, or a nice settings folder that can be synced.  Instead settings are intermingled with other data in a <code class=\"language-text\">~/.atom</code> folder, a fact that is obscured by the editor’s UI, which attempts to put a nice UI in front of all of these setting files and steer you away from editing them directly or caring about where they’re stored.  Which works great until you need to move your config to a new machine or sync between 2 machines.  </p>\n<p>Fortunately, there’s a great plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/atom-community/sync-settings\">sync-settings</a> that makes this simple.  It does require setting up a gist to serve as your repo, but after that the process is painless and allows you to continue on unaware of the implementation details behind settings.</p>\n<h4>5. Check Timecop and clean up plugins that you’re not using</h4>\n<p>Atom is built on web technologies.  This is both the best and worst thing about Atom.  It leads to its greatest strengths: hackability, a focus on UX early on since they didn’t have to build a whole UI engine from scratch, and quick iteration.  But it also has very real tradeoffs, the biggest of which are battery life and startup performance<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.  There’s not much to be done about the battery life drain; Atom is based on Chromium, and Chromium is a battery hog.  It is simply a tradeoff to understand when choosing an editor.  But startup performance is often greatly influenced by the packages that you choose to use.  Fortunately Atom includes a simple tool for tracking this called Timecop.</p>\n<p>You can find Timecop in the command palette (⇧⌘P by default).  When you run it, Timecop displays a report of all of your packages and themes and how they contribute to startup time.  It will look something like this:</p>\n<p>\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-0167c.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 65.93673965936739%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"screenshot of timecop\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-0167c.png 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I wouldn’t recommend obsessing too much over timecop.  For most packages the benefit you receive is going to significantly outweigh any startup burden.  But if your editor starts to feel sluggish, this is a great first step to figuring out if there’s anything you can drop to make an impact.</p>\n<h4>6. The UI is just HTML and CSS, and that means you can edit it</h4>\n<p>Everything you see in an Atom UI is an HTML element, with classes that you can use to select and style them. This fact is mostly relevant when creating themes, but you can also use it to make one-off UI adjustments.  For instance, when I edit Markdown files, the <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig\">editorconfig</a> plugin I have installed warns me about a possible conflict with another atom package.

I’ve been using <a href=\"https://atom.io\">Atom</a> as my primary text editor for a year and a half now, but I still occasionally play with other editors and keep up with their updates.  There are a crazy number of good cross platform editors these days, and they all have a bunch of good ideas that get shared and remixed across each other. This week Sublime Text came out with a new release <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev\">Dev Build 3132</a> that included 3 new color schemes.  One of them was Mariana, which I believe is a variation on the also great <a href=\"http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/\">Oceanic Next</a>, with possibly some influences from my previous favorite dark theme <a href=\"https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme\">Tommorrow Night Eighties</a> <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.

I built on the work of the great <a href=\"https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax\">atom-material-syntax</a> package to build out a new theme.  It turns out to be surprisingly easy to build a color scheme in Atom.  Fork an existing theme, change some colors and the details in package.json, delete a bunch of git tags <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, and then run <code class=\"language-text\">apm deploy minor</code>, and you’re in business.  </p>\n<p>You can now download <a href=\"https://atom.io/themes/mariana-syntax\">mariana-syntax</a> in Atom.  This was a quick port.  I’ll be working to optimize it for the languages I use (JS, Python, CSS/Less, HTML and Markdown) over the next few weeks.  I would love to see pull requests for other languages or for anything that I’ve missed so far.  I look forward to this just getting better and better. <strong>Update:</strong> Version 0.2.0 has shipped with optimized syntax for JavaScript, Python, CSS, JSON and Markdown.</p>\n<p>\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-7267d.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 83.00970873786407%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAARCAYAAADdRIy+AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACaUlEQVQ4y41U2XLaQBDUz7jyECMjCaFzV/eJOIQDduxyVR7y/7/Q6V0ZChOo5GHYXbTT2zM9M0Yx/EC/f0O7OcDLerhBAjdMMef6uIhgBxlmixjfrUDvLT/FoxPqVZ2fXAGT5oTTN8MMCvhxgW1Zo9u/o9/9RNtukLZriHZARFvmHdy0gSNrWHEFm2ZFpTb76myoCzEvj1WDpNujO36gPbyhXI9ImwF+tULYrDRwwL0jCUwfR9Q3zVAfXdlCZAOSvIQsCkT5CqIky7qBqLeQzYgF75wZierMzL4AV3vj9Idf7yC6EaIik2w1WVJr8LDaTMwuHO/tNUP1ogIQ5RYZw5bNFiEZ+nENScCIj9lXYdp3ARV9HgJZoSx7DbxkePOY4ZGhJbgq4/f5hRDOvZAV4EIoxxoZ2WyrHcbuiIK5a59f0Y6vqDdHNFzz4Qi/GJjP5szwL1FOLyjAvBxQZx1yOqRJizhbI2boCUVJCuaYucz6Z3h82Iq/CnMywwoLhlFQ6QYRwey8x4wFa4Y5nlThqj0L1tQrz7R5kGMe3jYtyhRC9aVQ79XZv0yH7KYd/HyAx1W1n5f2GvQkwlmIK1Vvqqx+lgSq9gesDh/YvvzC/v03ulF1ywtSllE+HBBQjEvQu4WtOyUhQ7ZXUK0RMfGi2UG2o25FPTAokE7LVbncKRt2SdIgYz9L1prgKqiqAtRKMtypd/8vr4b16eDSYclpsiSTidHEytK5nOzM6jOnlyLanFg2m8FQM81cCsw40749eXiYuZx9HhwvwoPpwgkEZJoikglMzkd1zwpS7aPnoSc5NyVLrcOjm+IPullL7uWsrxoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"screenshot of mariana-syntax\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/mariana-screenshot-a13c07ac2f3fde691852ce1738103fe8-7267d.png 824w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>To be clear, I’m not sure how great of an influence this was.

Sublime Text gives you a ton of power without ever touching\nyour mouse.  It takes a little while to get up to speed with its way of doing things, but the\nmore you use these shortcuts, the more you want to use Sublime Text.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: I will be using windows based commands for these examples.  In general they are the same for linux, and similar for OSX, with command replacing ctrl, and alt replacing shift in some cases.</strong></p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<h4>Ctrl + P  (Go To Anything)</h4>\n<p>We’re starting with the best here.  Ctrl + P opens up “Go To Anything”.  This allows for\nfuzzy search with Google Instant style results from among all open files and files in your current project.</p>\n<p>So you could start typing “mpag” and the editor would instantly load up mainPage.html into your editor pane, while showing a list of possible hits in your command palette, with a score next to them showing the confidence level of the match.  The speed of this feature is amazing.</p>\n<p>The real power of Go To Anything though comes when you combine it with subcommands.\nGo To Anything supports 3 subcommands</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@</strong> - this lets you specify a function within the file that you want to go to.  This can\nalso be fuzzy-matched, so chb@setbg might take you immediately to the setBackground\nmethod of the chartbuilder.js file.</li>\n<li><strong>:</strong> - this lets you go to a line by number.  So chb:100 will take you to line 100 of chartbuilder.js</li>\n<li><strong>#</strong> - this lets you search for a string in the file so chb#extend will take you to\nthe first occurence of “extend” in Chartbuilder.js.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use these subcommands by themselves (Ctrl+ subcommand) to navigate within the current file.</p>\n<p>After you’ve found the location you want, you can hit enter and begin editing immediately.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + alt + P (Switch Project)</h4>\n<p>Sublime Projects are a powerful way to organize your work.  Switching projects allows\nyou to instantly open all windows that you had left open the last time you used the project.\nThis gives you the ability to instant switch between work-items without losing momentum\ngetting things set up the way you want.  ctrl + alt + P lets you switch projects within\nyour current window.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + shift + P (Command Palette)</h4>\n<p>Sublime’s Command Palette probably deserves its own article.  But in essence this\nis the easiest way to control plugins, and also holds shortcuts for several of the lesser used\ncommands like setting syntax and controlling bookmarks.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + PgUp, Ctrl + PgDown (Switch Files)</h4>\n<p>These let you switch between your open files.  There are also Ctrl+tab and Ctrl+shift+tab, which are listed as\nnext file in stack and previous file in stack.  I have seen no difference between the behavior of these two\nsets of commands.  If anybody knows the difference, please enlighten me in the comments.</p>\n<h4>F2 and variants (Bookmark Commands)</h4>\n<p>Sublime Texts bookmarks make it easy to move to predetermined locations in the file.  Bookmarks are set to a specific location in the file. There are several shortcuts associated with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + F2</strong> - Toggles a bookmark from the current location.</li>\n<li><strong>F2</strong> - Go to next bookmark</li>\n<li><strong>Shift + F2</strong> - Go to previous bookmark</li>\n<li><strong>Alt + F2</strong> - puts a cursor at each bookmark location</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + F2</strong> - Clear all bookmarks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Search Commands</h4>\n<p>Sublime Text has a fairly standard set of search commands, with a few special twists</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + F</strong> - Search</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + F</strong> - Search in other files (gives a listing of all findings in a new file, you can use f4 to iterate over the results within their files)</li>\n<li><strong>F3</strong> - Find Next</li>\n<li><strong>Shift + F3</strong> - Find Previous</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + H</strong> - Replace</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + E</strong> - Search for current selection</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A few more minor shortcuts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + M</strong> - Go to a matching bracket.  Goes to the end of the innermost set of brackets if not currently on a bracket.</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K then Ctrl + C</strong> - Scrolls to move cursor to center of the screen</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selection and Multiple Cursors</h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful features of Sublime Text is its ability to easily select and manipulate text, especially\nthe way it can use multiple cursors simultaneously</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + D (Multiple Selection)</h4>\n<p>One of the cooler features of sublime text is its multiple selection option.  When you have some selected text,\nentering Ctrl+D selects the next instance of that selection.  You can do this repeatedly.  If you want to skip an instance\nyou can just hit Ctrl + K and then Ctrl + D again.  You can then edit all of the selections together, or use the multiple selections to make further changes.  The Esc key lets you go back to a single selection.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + L (Select Line)</h4>\n<p>I use this one all the time.  Allows you to select the entire line the cursor is on.  Combined with Ctrl + D you can select\nevery line a selection appears on.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Shift + L (Split Selection into lines)</h4>\n<p>Splits a multiline selection into individual line selections, giving you a cursor for each line</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + alt + Up/Down (Add a new line with a cursor)</h4>\n<p>Adds a new line above or below the current line with an additional cursor at that line.\nLets you quickly start multiple lines with the same content</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + D Select Current Word</h4>\n<p>Expands the selection to the current word</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Shift + Space - Expand selection to current block</h4>\n<p>The name of this feature in Sublime Text is “Expand selection to current scope”,\nbut thats misleading for javascript, which does not have block scope.  There are\na few more of these commands, but this and Ctrl + Shift + M (which appears to behave identically)\nare the relevant commands for Javascript.  Ctrl + Shift + A expands to tag for HTML.</p>\n<h3>Editing</h3>\n<h4>Ctrl + / (Add Comment)</h4>\n<p>If you add a shift it makes a block comment.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Enter (Move to a new line)</h4>\n<p>Moves to a new line below the current line.  Ctrl + Shift + Enter moves to a new line above the current line</p>\n<h4>Delete shortcuts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + del</strong> - Delete word forward (removes the rest of the word from cursor)</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + backspace</strong> - Delete word backward</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + K</strong> - Delete Line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K, Ctrl + K</strong> - Delete Line forward</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K, Ctrl + backspace</strong> - Delete line backwards</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Mark Commands</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + space</strong> - Add a mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + A</strong> - Select to mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + W</strong> - Delete To mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + X</strong> - Switch Location with mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + G</strong> - Clear Mark</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Some Quickies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + ]</strong> - Indent a line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + [</strong> - Unindent a line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + shift + up/down</strong> - Swap a line upwards/downwards</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + J</strong> - join line with next line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + D</strong> - Duplicate line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + T</strong> - Transposes the letter/word prior to the cursor with the one after.  I’ve never actually found a use for this in my js coding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Finding The Power</h3>\n<p>Of course the real power of these shortcuts happens when you start using them for real things and combining them together.\nHere are a few real life examples of ways sublime text can speed up everyday javascript coding.</p>\n<h4>Creating a Javascript array from a CSV</h4>\n<p>If you have a CSV full of data that you want to convert into a 2d js array, you can simply select the whole area,\nuse Ctrl + Shift + L, hit end to move to the end of the lines, insert a ”],” then hit home and add ”[” to the start of each line.\nFinally hit escape, then [ to surround the selection with brackets.  Finally hit the right arrow to move to the end of the selection\nand move back to delete the trailing comma.  The whole transformation can be done with 10 keystrokes.</p>\n<h4>Renaming a variable or function</h4>\n<p>This is an obvious one, but Ctrl + D allows you to easily select every instance of a selection.  You can switch over “false positives” with Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D</p>\n<h4>Code Formatting</h4>\n<p>Want to move your curly brackets to a new line after the expression?  Ctrl +D all ”){” instances then move left and enter.  You can move it back by selecting the plain { and using backspace, though you may need to skip some.  Fixing indentation is easy with Ctrl + [ and ctrl + ].</p>\n<h4>Editing in 2 functions</h4>\n<p>If you’re working on 2 functions, bookmarks can be great ways to easily navigate back and forth between 2 (or more sections of code)</p>\n<h3>This is just the start</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text is what you make of it.  If you use it regularly I suggest that you learn to use it well.\nYou don’t need to learn all the shortcuts, but find a few that work for you and make you a faster, more efficient coder.</p>\n<p>If you have suggestions for other great uses of keyboard shortcuts in Sublime Text, please leave them in the comments.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Text Editors","Sublime Text"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Sublime Text For Javascript: Configuration","description":"Helpful configuration options for JS developers","layout":"post","path":"/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration","date":"2013-01-01T18:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’m starting a new series of posts on Sublime Text, and how to get the most out of the editor.\nThe series will be focused on Javascript development, as that is how I use Sublime Text, but it should be applicable to any developer who uses Sublime Text as part of their workflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Keyboard Shortcuts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/01/03/sublime-text-for-javascript-plugins\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Packages</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text allows for plenty of text editing power out of the box, but the real power comes\nwhen you begin configuring it to meet your own needs.  This is by definition a topic that different people will approach in different ways, but in this post I will attempt to give an overview of what is configurable in Sublime Text (<strong>Spoiler: almost everything</strong>), and how to configure them.</p>\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text settings are defined using json files.  There are multiple levels of configuration\nto give you very fine grained control of how your editor will act for different files.\nFrom the <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/settings.html\">Sublime Docs</a>,  settings are prioritized like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Settings files are consulted in this order:</p>\n<p>Packages/Default/Preferences.sublime-settings\nPackages/Default/Preferences (platform).sublime-settings\nPackages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings\n&#x3C;Project Settings >\nPackages/ &#x3C;syntax > / &#x3C;syntax >.sublime-settings\nPackages/User/&#x3C;syntax >.sublime-settings\n&#x3C;Buffer Specific Settings ></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Settings can be set on a default, user, project, or syntax-type basis, and add specific\nsettings for distraction free mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Never set your options using the Default-Settings files!</strong></p>\n<p>The default settings files for Sublime text will be overwritten when you update\nto a new version, and the plugin specific settings will be overwritten when those\nplugins are updated.  Always use the “User-Settings” files instead for “global”\nsettings.  Its not a bad idea to immediately copy the default settings file to\nthe User-Settings file when you’re initially setting up sublime so that you can\nsee all of the options that are set in that file and edit them accordingly.</p>\n<p>Heres my User-Settings file for my Windows-based version of Sublime:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    // Modified Solarized Theme with Mardown Support (https<span class=\"token operator\">:</span>//gist.github.com/<span class=\"token number\">1904917</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n   <span class=\"token property\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/User/Solarized (Light).tmTheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_face\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Consolas\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_size\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Valid options are <span class=\"token string\">\"no_bold\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_italic\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"gray_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    // <span class=\"token string\">\"subpixel_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_round\"</span> (OS X only<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> and <span class=\"token string\">\"directwrite\"</span> (Windows only<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"directwrite\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // If enabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> will highlight any line with a caret\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"highlight_line\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Set to <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> to automatically save files when switching to a different file\n    // or application\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"save_on_focus_lost\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Columns in which to display vertical rulers\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"rulers\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token number\">80</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // The theme controls the look of Sublime Text's UI (buttons<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> tabs<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> scroll bars<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> etc<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"theme\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Set to <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> to close windows as soon as the last file is closed<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> unless\n    // there's a folder open within the window.

If you don’t\nlike something about how the program looks, it is probably configurable. Some of the\nmost important visual settings are below:</p>\n<h4>Color Scheme</h4>\n<p>The most obvious configurable visual setting is the color scheme.  Sublime ships\nwith a solid selection of default color schemes, and its easy to find and download\nmore online with <a href=\"http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\">Package Control</a>, which I’ll cover more in the\nplugins article.  I use Sublime’s Monokai Bright theme for JS development, and a\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1904917\">custom Solarized theme</a> for writing in Markdown for this blog and my\nnotes.  You can set color scheme with a command like this in one of your settings files</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token string\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/User/Solarized (Light).tmTheme\"</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>or you can set it in the preferences menu on the top of the screen (this will set it\nin your User-Settings file)</p>\n<h4>Theme</h4>\n<p>You can also configure the overall look and feel of the application.  While the\ndefault is by no means ugly, many people prefer the <a href=\"https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/\">Soda</a> theme that adds\nsome prettier gradients and a choice of a light/dark theme.  You can set that\nlike this after downloading the theme:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token string\">\"theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Quickies</h4>\n<p>Here are a few more quick visual tweaks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“rulers”: set where to show vertical rulers.  Takes an array of integers.  I put one at 80 in order to limit my line lengths in javascript.</li>\n<li>“tab_size”,“translate_tabs_to_spaces”, and “use_tab_stops: Determine space and tabs behaviors.</li>\n<li>“highlight_line”: If true will highlight every line with a cursor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Bindings</h3>\n<p>This is where all of the information from <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts\">Monday’s post</a> starts to become a whole lot less useful.  All of the keyboard shortcuts that were discussed in that post are completely configurable.  Again you want to use the “User” preferences file in\nPackages/User to set the keybindings.  Keybindings are stored in json form like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+z\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"undo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+shift+z\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"redo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+y\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"redo_or_repeat\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+u\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"soft_undo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+shift+u\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"soft_redo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You can override existing shortcuts to make common commands more convenient or\ncreate your own by combining <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/commands\">sublime commands</a>.  One cool trick is the ability to define keyboard shortcuts to toggle settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The toggle_setting command can be used to toggle a setting. For example, to make a key binding that toggles the word_wrap setting on the current file, you can use (in Preferences/Key Bindings - User):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"alt+w\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"toggle_setting\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"args\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"setting\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"word_wrap\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The set_setting command can be used to set a setting to a specific value. For example, this key binding makes the current file use the Cobalt color scheme:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+k\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+c\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"set_setting\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"args\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"setting\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"value\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Cobalt.tmTheme\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The settings modified here are buffer specific settings: they override any settings placed in a settings file, but apply to the current file only.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>Plugins also sometimes have their own configuration files.  These generally mimic the format of the editor, and its adviced as usual to use the User Settings for these so as to avoid having your settings blown away with updates</p>\n<h3>Build Systems</h3>\n<p>Sublime also lets you configure custom build systems to build your project.  These can be defined at the same levels of everything else, though in this case it probably makes most sense at the syntax and project level.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<p>Projects are a great way to organize your Sublime Text files.  You can set up a project\nat any time by creating a .sublime-project file (this will happen automatically if you choose save project or edit project in the Project toolbar menu).  The project configuration menu takes a list of folders, a list of settings, and a list of build system settings as a JSON file.  These settings will then override your user level settings for files in the folders that you specify.  This lets you meet project specifications for things like tabs or line length without constantly fiddling with settings.  You also can enable or disable different plugins based on project, and create visual distinction between projects with different color themes.</p>\n<h3>Macros</h3>\n<p>Macros let you save a series of common commands as a json file.  You can then run them\nfrom the “Tools/Macro” menu.  There’s more information in the <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/macros.html\">unofficial docs</a></p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>One final thing that you can configure in Sublime Text is “Snippets”.  Sublime Snippets provide advanced templating ability thats configured with an XML template.  A detailed description of what you can do with snippets is available in the <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html\">unofficial docs</a>.  Suffice it to say that it allows everything from a simple text replacement to full  templating based on a variety of environment variables.</p>\n<p>Sublime contains several Javascript related snippets by default for several basic tasks, and there are more that you can find in other places around the internet.  <a href=\"http://freshbrewedcode.com/jonathancreamer/2012/07/13/a-couple-of-useful-javascript-sublime-text-2-snippets/\">Here’s one example by Jonathan Creamer</a> with a few snippets for plugin development, and a nice little console.log snippet for quick development.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pretty much everything in Sublime can be customized using JSON files</li>\n<li>Use User files or project/syntax specific files, not the Default files</li>\n<li>Learn your options and you can get a lot more out of Sublime Text</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this is helpful.  I’ll be following up with one final post later this week on helpful Sublime plugins for javascript development.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,interesting-atom,vim-files","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Discovering Vim","description":"The benefits I've found learning Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/06/02/discovering-vim","date":"2014-06-02T22:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’ve now been using Vim as my primary text editor for the last 9 months.\nWhen I started, I intended to learn it well enough to use in environments that didn’t support Sublime Text. In the end though it ended up becoming my single purpose editor for all occasions. Writing code, blogging, diffs, and reading logs all go through vim.  So why do I use Vim?</p>\n<h4>More Efficient Movement and Editing</h4>\n<p>This is the first thing you hear about from experienced Vimmers, and its an important one.  Once you have your feet under you as a Vim user, you are just able to edit faster.  This can be hard to understand before using Vim (or other keyboard based tools).  Using a mouse doesn’t feel particularly inefficient, and when you start out, Vim’s keyboard mappings can feel arbitrary, unintuitive and slow.  This is one of those times where a little work is needed to get the proper perspective.  Once you’ve had time to learn the basics, even a mediocre typist like me <sup id=\"fnref:1\">\n<a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> can fly when editing by typing smarter not harder.  This isn’t a tutorial on the basics of Vim, but the keys for me were understanding Vim was <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118\">a language in its own right</a>, and the biggest gains in Vim come when you create repeatable options to eliminate inefficiencies. These can be macros, but can also be as simple as using Vim’s easy control for repeating the last action<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>.  Vim is a huge toolbox of small tools that you can use together to create a powerful workstation.</p>\n<h4>Rich Plugin Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Like many things in Vim, the value of its plugin system wasn’t immediately obvious.  Unlike Sublime, which has a community consensus primary package manager and repository, Vim has multiple package managers that pull packages from a variety of locations<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>.  So you need to do some research to figure out what you should be using<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup> and find the right plugins.  But when you do, you’ll find that Vim has fantastic plugins for key tasks like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">fuzzy file search</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">syntax checking</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">in-file search</a>.  It also has a rich depth of plugins for pretty much every language/framework/functionality in common usage, as well as some great plugins that extend Vim’s built in motion/editing language.</p>\n<h4>Long Term Security</h4>\n<p>This one is a judgement call, but from my point of view, Vim is the safest investment of my time out there.  It has a rich open source community, one that has shown that its willing to try <a href=\"http://neovim.org/\">some big ideas</a> to keep from getting stale.  It’s had a great 20 years of usage and doesn’t appear to be in decline.  Sublime Text meanwhile, regrettably seems to be in danger of heading down a similar path to Textmate, with a single developer who has done great work, but <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#x26;t=14591\">doesn’t appear to be interested</a> in being involved in all of the different work that a software business requires.  I don’t think open source is the only way to rely on software<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>, but for general purpose text editors, Vim seems the safest bet to still be around in 10 years.</p>\n<h4>My Brain is Broken Now</h4>\n<p>This is a warning as much as a reason for using Vim, but I’ve quickly found that I’m no longer able to use Sublime or other editors without being frustrated by the fact that they’re not Vim.  Many editors, including Sublime, provide support for a large subset of Vim’s key bindings and modal controls.  But they all fall down at random places.  The power of vim doesn’t lie in one specific functionality, but the composable nature of their different options.  When some of them aren’t there, all the others are weakened, and my trained brain falls out of high efficiency mode into slow plodding “think through every keystroke mode.”  So don’t say I didn’t warn you.  Vim will break your brain.</p>\n<p>Those are the primary reasons I use Vim now.  There are a few things I haven’t loved though.</p>\n<h4>Vim’s UI is uglier than Sublime Text.</h4>\n<p>I’m a front end developer, used to working with, and working to create, beautiful interfaces.  Vim is not beautiful.  It looks like exactly what it is, a text based program with a lineage reaching back to the 70s.  It doesn’t handle margins or padding well, doesn’t have pretty autocomplete menus or visual alerts.  If you use it in the terminal you may be severely restricted in your color options, and this situation is not something that is going to change anytime soon<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup>.  I still love Sublime Text’s UI.  Nice margins, smooth scrolling, the ability to set different font and syntax highlighting options on a filetype basis are all nice gems that Vim just doesn’t offer.  I’ve come to appreciate Vim’s minimalism, but would love to see if Neovim were to offer a way to beautify some of these things.</p>\n<h4>Vim is harder to learn than it should be.</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some Vimmers object to this (its a power user tool, etc.) but the truth is, when pretty much every Vim tutorial starts by telling you that you should start by changing a bunch of the default settings, it becomes clear that learning Vim is harder than it should be. There’s no reason that basics like line numbers and syntax highlighting shouldn’t be turned on by default.  Configurability is great, but if you start out in a user-hostile state, many people won’t take the time to find the power.  There have been some efforts to change that.  Neovim seems to be actively rethinking this stuff, and projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> aim to help people get started with a richer initial setup.  But the very existence of these reforms points to the fact that Vim shoots itself in the foot with defaults that may have made sense in the eighties, but appear archaic next to modern competitors.</p>\n<p>For now I’m enjoying the Vim experience.  Despite a few warts, I really do think its the best text editor you can use today, and I’m excited to see where it goes in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\nI was never taught to type correctly growing up.

Instead of teaching you how Vim works, they toss a bunch of scary looking code at you, tell you to shove it in a file, and claim that it will make Vim just like Textmate / Sublime / Emacs / Visual Studio. Except way cooler!  People quickly find out that if what they want is to use their old editor, they should just <em>use their old editor</em>, and learn to use it as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>While writing about Vim the last few weeks, I’ve avoided recommending any configuration changes, other than the quick <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">sanity vimrc</a> I recommended in the first article, because I think it’s important to learn what sets Vim apart before trying to configure it.  Not because it’s good enough without configuration (honestly it’s not), but because once you understand the core, you can use configuration to build a great version of Vim instead of trying to hack together a Rube-Goldberg Textmate clone. But now that I’ve covered some of the basics (and if you haven’t yet, feel free to go ahead and start at <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">the beginning</a>), it’s time to look at Vim configuration.</p>\n<h3>Basic Configuration</h3>\n<p>Configuration for Vim starts with a vimrc file. It’s a text file located by default at <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vimrc</code> on *nix systems, and <code class=\"language-text\">$VIM\\_vimrc</code> on Windows.  To begin configuration you need to open that file, creating it if it doesn’t exist. But before we go further, we should stop and figure out what we’re doing.</p>\n<p>I said that configuration starts with the vimrc file, but the truth is that your vimrc is just a normal text file that Vim sources by default.  The heart of Vim configuration is Vimscript, Vim’s custom scripting language.  Vimscript is a full programming language, with variables and control structures.  But for this article we’re going to focus on using it for configuration.</p>\n<p>The basic commands that Vimscript uses for configuration are <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">set</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">let</code> allows you to change a variable value with the syntax <code class=\"language-text\">let &lt;var-name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">set</code> allows you to read or change an option value using <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;</code> for toggle options or <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;=&lt;option-value&gt;</code> for numeric or string-based options. <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> and its many variations allow you to create new keymappings by setting the output of one key combination to produce the value of another key combination.  You can use variations on map to specify how a key sequence should behave in different vim modes.</p>\n<h3>Know what you’re configuring</h3>\n<p>Now that you know the basic commands, I could show you an example .vimrc, explain it a bit and then tell you to copy it, change the stuff you don’t like, and go on your way.  The problem with that? It leaves your vimrc file as a “pile of junk”, that I understand and you don’t.   If I did a good job, you might understand the purpose of individual lines, but they probably wouldn’t be the best fit for you, and you probably wouldn’t know exactly how to make it better.  In the end you’ll keep tossing junk onto it until it becomes a confusing mess you want to avoid.  So instead, I’m going to walk through the types of configurations you might want to consider, give a few examples, and let you build from there.  So here are a few concepts to think about as you construct your vimrc file:</p>\n<h4>Adapt to your environment</h4>\n<p>Vi and Vim were originally developed in a low-resource terminal based environment.  Many of their default settings and assumptions reflect that.  Today though Vim is used in a wide variety of ways, from multimonitor Mac Pros with 16+GB of memory running multiple MacVim windows, to low memory remote servers running Vim in the terminal over ssh.  If you know what your environment will look like, you can optimize Vim for your own use.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you’re running in a high resource environment, (and pretty much any modern laptop or desktop these days qualifies as a high resource environment) you may want to enable some features that Vim disables by default, since those removing those features allow it to work well in very low memory situations.  Some  common choices:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable &quot; Turn on syntax highlighting\nset hidden &quot; Leave hidden buffers open\nset history=100 &quot;by default Vim saves your last 8 commands.  We can handle more</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>On the other hand, if you know you’re going to be running remotely on low resource machines, you might choose to disable those options to minimize the load and increase speed. I’ll talk more about plugins in a later post, but they’re another thing that works much better in your local environment than on remote servers, for both performance and logistical reasons.</p>\n<h4>Add some visual niceties</h4>\n<p>If we’re honest, I think most people can agree Vim is pretty hard to look at out of the box.  Very few visual affordances, no syntax highlighting or line numbers, and it’s style is dependent on your terminal color scheme or an ugly default gVim theme. But that’s pretty easy to fix. We can get syntax highlighting and line numbers with this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable\nset number</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Getting a decent color scheme will require you to download it as a plugin, but if you’ve done that or if you like one of the colorschemes that ship with your Vim distribution it’s easy to set up with <code class=\"language-text\">colorscheme &lt;theme-name&gt;</code>.  Beyond that, there’s plenty more you can do to improve the visual feel of Vim.  I’d look into customizing your status bar, relative vs absolute line numbers, and plugins like <a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Vim-Thematic</a>.</p>\n<h4>Set up keybindings</h4>\n<p>Many of Vim’s useful commands are either not given default keybindings, or are given hard to remember obtuse ones.  Don’t want to spend your whole life typing <code class=\"language-text\">source ~/.vimrc</code> into each file everytime you add something to your configuration? I shortcut that to <code class=\"language-text\">\\rr</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">map &lt;leader&gt;rr :source ~/.vimrc&lt;CR&gt;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You might be wondering what the <leader> notation is there.  The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;leader&gt;</code> key is a Vim convention for a key that comes before user created keystrokes.  It’s meant to minimize conflicts, and allow plugins to provide default mappings while still allowing the user a bit of flexibility.  The leader key can be set in your vimrc with the command <code class=\"language-text\">let mapleader=&lt;yourleaderkey&gt;</code>.  The default is <code class=\"language-text\">\\</code>, and I would recommend leaving it that way to start.  You can change it later if you find it to be inconvenient, and it doesn’t cause any conflicts since its the default key.  Common replacements like <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> overwrite useful functionality that may not be immediately obvious (<code class=\"language-text\">,</code> allows you to move backwards on a characterwise search for instance).</p>\n<h4>Configure plugins and file-type specific settings</h4>\n<p>I’ll touch more on plugins in a future post, but many of them allow extensive configuration, including setting keybindings, changing default behaviors, and enabling/disabling extra functionality. All of that happens here in the vimrc and should mostly use the let/set/map commands that we’ve already seen.</p>\n<p>You can also set file-type specific rules.  Rather than placing these in your main vimrc, these go into a special “file type plugins” directory, <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vim/ftplugin</code>.  Within that directory, you can create files like javascript.vim, python.vim or html.vim, and those files will be loaded after the vimrc when you open files of that type. Using those files, you can create completely separate profiles for each file type.</p>\n<h3>Discover what’s out there</h3>\n<p>I’ve intentionally avoided telling you what your vimrc should look like here.  I’ve tried to show you the big picture of what you can do, and now I’ll leave it to you to figure out what pieces you need to be comfortable and productive.  It will be different for everybody.</p>\n<p>My advice?  Now that you know what you’re looking for, go and take a look at other people’s configurations. Start with something like this <a href=\"https://github.com/benmccormick/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">vimrc boilerplate</a>, and add the things you like.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to find good configurations online if you look.  <a href=\"https://github.com/ben336/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">My vimrc file</a> is on Github.  It’s certainly not the best out there, but its relatively small and easy to follow.  If you know developers you admire who use Vim, ask to see their vimrc files, or see if they have any fancy tricks to share.  For those without those resources,  Github’s <a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">dotfile page</a> is a great place to look.  It contains links to several very detailed “dotfile repos” from various developers. You don’t have to copy everything from these files (in fact you shouldn’t), but you can pull the things that look useful, get rid of things that don’t, and try things out as you slowly build up your own workspace, built to do the jobs that you need it to do.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">Github’s dotfile page</a> provides some great pointers to dotfile repositories from experienced developers that can help you come up with cool configuration ideas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> is a great resource for users who’d prefer to avoid configuration and just start with a useable editor.  Though if that’s you, you may find you’re better off <a href=\"http://delvarworld.github.io/blog/2013/03/16/just-use-sublime-text/\">just using Sublime Text</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/07/14/learning-vim-in-2014-configuring-vim"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Copy and Paste the Vim Way","description":"How to use copy and paste in Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/07/27/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way","date":"2014-07-27T23:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>If you’ve been following <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/tag/learning-vim-in-2014/\">my series on Vim</a>, it should be clear now that Vim has a pretty clear philosophy of how text editing should work. It’s based on the Unix philosophy of small composable tools, and doesn’t necessarily match up with the conventions that other editors use for common commands.  So it’s probably not surprising that Vim has its own way of handling copy and paste operations, and in fact doesn’t even use those terms.  Vim’s copy and paste handling is minimalist, composable, and powerful, but most people take some time to adjust to it.  I’m going to walk through the basics here, along with a few advanced features that are worth knowing about.</p>\n<p>The primary Vim commands for copying something are <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> (yank) which acts like most people’s view of copy, and the delete/substitute commands <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> (delete),<code class=\"language-text\">c</code> (change), <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> (single character delete), and <code class=\"language-text\">s</code> (substitute), which unintuitively all act like the more common concept of “cut”.  These can be <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">composed with motion commands to select different regions</a>.  </p>\n<p>Any Vim command that deletes text will also save a copy of that text unless you specifically tell it not too.  The idiomatic Vim method of deleting without copying is <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code>, which probably sounds bizarre.  We’ll come back to that later, and you’ll see that it makes sense in the bigger scheme of Vim’s copy and paste system.</p>\n<p>The basic Vim commands for paste are <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> (put) which pastes after of the current character/line and <code class=\"language-text\">P</code> which pastes before the current character/line.  Vim auto detects whether you’ve yanked text on a line by line basis or a character by character basis, and pastes accordingly. Basically, if you select only full lines it will paste line by line and not break on the cursor position, if you select any partial lines it will paste at the character level, starting or ending at the current cursor location.  Note that <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> also works in visual mode, where it will replace the current selection.</p>\n<p>All of this leads to a very common annoyance for new Vim users.  They’re editing a document and yank some text.  Then they go to a new location, delete a few lines, and hit <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> to replace them with the copied text.  Do you see the problem?  The text that is “put” is not what they originally yanked, but instead it’s the contents of their last delete action. Obviously this can be worked around by changing the order of the actions, but it’s frustrating to users who are used to being able to easily delete without blowing away their paste action.  Even more frustrating is when an experienced Vim user comes by and tells them the answer to their problem is to just type <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;0p</code> instead. Which will in fact put the correct text. So what’s going on with the weird syntax for these basic action?</p>\n<h4>Registers</h4>\n<p>What we’re missing is a clear understanding of how Vim handles copy and paste operations.  So let’s clarify.  Unlike most modern systems, which have a clipboard that holds a single value, Vim can store the values of yank and delete commands in one of many registers.  It has 26 normal registers, which correspond to the letters of the alphabet, and several “special” registers.  One of those special registers is the default register, which is where yank and delete commands store their content by default.  Other registers can be accessed with the <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;&lt;char&gt;</code> prefix that we’ve already seen.  So in the above example, the text from the initial example is moved into the default register, and then replaced there by the deleted text.  But it remains in the 0 register, which always points to the last “yanked” text, ignoring text gained by deleting.</p>\n<p>The 26 alphabetical registers serve as great “medium term” storage.  You can use them to yank something that you want to have around for a while, and then put it in a few different places, even if you’re yanking and deleting other things in the meantime.  These will even persist across sessions as long as you have the <code class=\"language-text\">nocompatible</code> option set in your vimrc file.  However if you overwrite one, there’s no easy way to get it back.  </p>\n<p>One cool feature of registers is the built in ability to append to the end of them.  If you want to add text to an existing register, for instance if you missed part of the text you wanted to yank, you can do so by capitalizing the register.  So if you had deleted a line and put it in the <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;add</code>, but meant to include a second line, you could then delete the next line and append it to the register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Add</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ap</code> would then put the 2 lines back into the document.</p>\n<h4>Special Registers</h4>\n<p>In addition to the alphabetical registers, there are several <em>special registers</em> that are worth knowing about.  I already mentioned the default register, which most Vim users know about, even if they don’t understand exactly how registers work.  Other important registers are the clipboard register, the black hole register, and the numbered registers.</p>\n<p>If you have to learn one special register, learn the clipboard register.  One of the first things people notice about copy and paste in Vim is that it doesn’t interact nicely with other applications’ copy and paste by default.  If you yank a line of text in Vim, it’s not added to the system clipboard.  If you copy some code from Stack Overflow and try to paste it in Vim with <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>, it won’t work <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.  But, since we know about registers, it makes sense that the default register might not be mapped to the clipboard, which we don’t want getting blasted away everytime we delete a character.</p>\n<p>Vim isn’t completely disconnected from the system clipboard though.  The clipboard register <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> is Vim’s proxy to your system clipboard.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+y&lt;motion&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+p</code> act like traditional copy and paste.  Your version of Vim does have to be compiled with clipboard support in order to use the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> register. You can check to see if you have clipboard support with <code class=\"language-text\">:echo has(&#39;clipboard&#39;).</code><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> On OSX you can use MacVim to get clipboard support, since the default version of Vim shipped with OSX is not compiled with it.  On other operating systems you’ll have to investigate the easiest way to install with clipboard support if your version doesn’t have it.  It should be enabled for most modern mainstream distributions.</p>\n<p>Another register to quickly note is the black hole register <code class=\"language-text\">_</code>.  The black hole register, as you would expect, doesn’t retain what’s passed to it.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_y</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_p</code> are no-ops, and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code> is “true delete”, as opposed to the delete commands default “cut” like behavior.  Of course since most people don’t use all 26 alphabetical registers, you can also achieve effective true delete by deleting to any unused register.</p>\n<p>Finally, the number keys also have special register functionality.  You can’t yank text directly to a numbered register.  Instead the <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> register contains the last yanked text, and the <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> through <code class=\"language-text\">9</code> registers contain the last 9 deleted chunks of text.  This feature is a cool idea, but unfortunately the implementation is inconsistent and a bit weird.  For one thing the distinction between yanked and deleted text seems arbitrary, and since they act the same in other ways, puts an added cognitive load on the user to remember which one they used.  Secondly, for whatever reason, deletions that span less than a line get special behavior.  If you delete these to an alphabetical register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code> just like any other delete.  But if you delete them to the default register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;-</code> and not put in <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code>.  The logic is complicated enough that the numbered registers become tough to use in day to day tasks, and I’ll have to agree with Drew Neil in labeling them one of Vim’s <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/\">“bad parts.”</a></p>\n<h4>Macros</h4>\n<p>One last important thing to know about registers is that along with being used for copy and paste, they serve as a place to save macros, Vim’s reusable command language.  You can save a macro by typing <code class=\"language-text\">q&lt;register key&gt;&lt;commands&gt;q</code>, and the macro will be saved to the register.  Like yank and delete, capitalizing the register name will let you append to the register instead of replacing it. So there’s a few things you should know about that.  One, if you use macros, don’t save macros to the same registers that you use for copy and paste.  If you use the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> register a lot for the convenience of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;yy&lt;motion&gt;</code>, don’t use <code class=\"language-text\">qy</code> to save your macro unless you’re ok with it being blown away by your next yank.  Two, the sharing of registers allows you to copy text to use as a macro.  So if you for instance wanted to have a file with a list of common operations, it would be easy to go to that file, copy a line, and then execute it as a macro.  This isn’t the first thing most people will want to do, but it illustrates the power and flexibility that come when you start combining Vim’s tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a more in depth look at Vim’s special registers, including a bunch I didn’t cover here, you can check out this great <a href=\"http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/advanced-vim-registers/\">roundup</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/categories/copy-and-paste/\">Vimcasts</a> has a whole series of posts on copy and paste in Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Of course some people would probably see that as a feature, not a bug\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2\">\n        <p>\n        Thanks to schweinschmeisser on Reddit for reminding me to add a way to check for support.\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/07/27/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Search","description":"How to search for anything in Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","date":"2014-08-04T01:16:20+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Have you ever tried to summarize something that was just too big to explain?  I’ve covered a lot of ground in my posts on Vim this past month, but it’s only scratched the surface of what Vim has to offer.  The goal was to create a foundation that people could start with, and then let them build on their own. There’s not a conclusive way to say what somebody “needs to know” when learning Vim.  Most people don’t (and shouldn’t) use every feature of the editor, they use the ones that make sense for them.  So I’ve tried to cover the things that I know people have found useful, and the philosophy behind how Vim works, and then let you figure out what you’d like to use on your own.  This post wraps up the series, but I wanted to highlight one last feature of Vim, its fantastic search capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Vim has an extremely powerful built in search tool.  To use it, you can type <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> at anytime in normal mode to start entering search terms.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code> followed by enter searches for the next occurrence of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document.  You can then skip over matches with <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> or go backwards with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code>.  If you wanted to start by searching backwards, you could have started with <code class=\"language-text\">?foo</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code>, in which case <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> would reverse behavior, with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> moving forward in the document and <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> moving back.  It’s easiest to think of <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> as “next match” and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> as “previous match”, with the direction determined by the search operator, <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">?</code>.</p>\n<p>The search tool can be used for more than simple literal expressions, it also takes regular expressions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">/fo.\\|bar</code> will match <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">fox</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  You also can search for lines containing both foo and bar with the expression <code class=\"language-text\">/.*foo\\&amp;.*bar</code>.  If you want to dig deeper into Vim’s regex language, I’d recommend typing in <code class=\"language-text\">:h pattern</code> to check out the excellent documentation.</p>\n<h3>Substitute</h3>\n<p>Search is great, but in many cases what we want to use it for is replacing or acting on each instance.  Vim’s search and replace command looks something like <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/foo/bar/g</code>, which will replace all occurences of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  Let’s break that down a bit.  <code class=\"language-text\">:s</code> (substitute) is Vim’s search and replace command.  By default it only works on the current line, so in order to get it to act on the whole document I prepended the <code class=\"language-text\">%</code> character, which sets the range to include everything.  If you want a smaller range, you can select the text you want to act on in visual mode. Typing <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> will then preload the range into the command area.  Substitute takes an expression in the form <code class=\"language-text\">/&lt;search expression&gt;/&lt;replace string&gt;/&lt;modifiers&gt;</code>  where search expression defines the search, replace string is the text to substitute in, and modifiers are single letter arguments that change the behavior.  By default only the first instance of an expression per line is substituted, so I added the <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> modifier to tell Vim to substitute all instances of the search expression on a line.  Other useful modifiers are <code class=\"language-text\">i</code>, which makes the search case insensitive, and <code class=\"language-text\">c</code> which has Vim prompt for confirmation before substituting each instance. Confirmation is helpful if you want to change most but not all occurences of a phrase. One useful behavior of substitute to be aware of: If you leave the search expression blank, it reuses your last search.  So if you’ve been playing around with a regex to get the right expression, once you get it right you can type <code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;replacement&gt;/g</code>, and it will replace all instances, without forcing you to retype your complicated regex.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that search plays nicely with Vim’s <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">composable actions</a>, and you can use it as a motion command with <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">c</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> or other actions.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">d/foo</code> will delete all text up to the next occurence of foo in the document. <code class=\"language-text\">y?foo</code> will yank all text backwards to the previous occurence of foo in the document.</p>\n<h3>Inline Searching</h3>\n<p>Along with the primary search and substitute commands, Vim has other specialty searching tools.  One of these is its <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> commands. <code class=\"language-text\">f&lt;char&gt;</code> moves to a single character on the current line.  While less powerful than <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, this can be super useful because of its quick composability and guarantee of not moving out of the current scope.  It’s really easy to type <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> to delete through the end of the parentheses.  <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> works similarly, but is non-inclusive, so you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ct)</code> to delete everything up to and not including the parentheses.  I remember it as “change find character” and “change to character” respectively.  Like <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, these commands support backwards and repeated search.  <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">T</code> search backwards on the current line, and <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> are the default commands for “next match” and “previous match” respectively.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file searching with vimgrep and grep</h3>\n<p>Searching within a file is nice, but what if you want to search in multiple files?  Vim provides 2 commands for that.  The first, <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep</code>, uses Vim’s internal regex engines to search across multiple files. You could for instance type <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep /function/i ./*.js</code> to search all Javascript files in the current directory for the “function” keyword.  You’d then be able to loop through them using the <code class=\"language-text\">:ln</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:lp</code> commands.</p>\n<p>The second command, <code class=\"language-text\">:grep</code>, integrates with an external search application (grep by default), to do the searching.  The advantage of the first is that it’s portable and will be available anywhere and everywhere that Vim is.  But generally external tools are going to be faster than Vim’s internal search engine.  Grep for instance is faster than vimgrep.  I personally use the external tool <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> which is faster than grep.  Regardless though, Vim has support for whatever approach you choose to take.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file replace with the arglist</h3>\n<p>Up till now we’ve mostly been dealing with tasks that Vim has good answers for.  If you want to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim though, you end up in some of the more esoteric parts of Vim-land.  In order to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim, you need to first define a set of files to edit, and then run the replace command.  Unfortunately there is no way in Vim to cleanly do this all in a single command.  Instead you must pull your list of files from one of 3 places, the arglist, the buffer list, or the window list.  The arglist is by default the files that you specified to open when you initially opened Vim, the buffer list is your list of currently opened buffers, and the window list is the list of files in currently open windows.  Since you probably don’t want to have to open or view all the files that you want to run a search/replace on, and you may want to have files open or visible without running a replace on them, the arglist is the list of choice for replacements.  Vim allows you to edit the contents of the arglist at any time using the <code class=\"language-text\">:argadd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">argdelete</code> commands.  So to replace <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code> for all javascript files in the current directory you might type something like.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">:argd * &quot;Clear arglist\n:arga ./*.js  &quot;Add javascript files\n:argdo %s/foo/bar/g &quot;Substitute on each file</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">argdo</code> is the command to execute a command across all files in the arglist.  <code class=\"language-text\">bufdo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">tabdo</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">windo</code> work the same way for every “open buffer”, “active window in each tab”, and “window in the current tab” respectively. Personally I find this all to be a pain.  A single command that let you specify an action and a range to run it on like <code class=\"language-text\">:do &#39;%s/foo/bar/g&#39; ./*.js</code> would make plenty of sense.  But since that doesn’t exist, it’s worth at least knowing that the arglist is there, and being able to resort to it if necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Power Of Search</h3>\n<p>Most people start out using Vim knowing that they can move around with <em>hjkl</em> and switch between files with <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code> as they learn more they grow their toolbox. Search is a great tool for moving quickly around text in Vim, and for powerfully making big edits.  Searching allows you to allow your brain to focus on the big picture, rather than remembering exactly where each piece of code or content is located. Like everything else in Vim, it’s a tool that you can combine with other tools to create powerful workflows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/\">Vimcasts</a> has a nice piece on the <code class=\"language-text\">gn</code> command, an alternative to <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> that lets you select the next search match in visual mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace\">Vim’s wiki</a> also has a nice writeup of the <code class=\"language-text\">:substitute</code> command, with lots of examples and details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: The Basics","description":"The basics of learning Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics","date":"2014-06-30T11:28:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Do you want to be efficient writing code?  Using Vim can be a powerful help.  Using it has let me move more effectively through the process of writing and editing code.  But getting to where I am now was frustrating. Vim resources are scattered across the web, and contain a lot of different advice.  It’s tough to figure out how to make Vim work for you.  In my next few posts, I’m going to talk about the process of learning a 23 year old programming power tool, and what you need to know in 2014 to be productive with Vim.  Today I’ll start with the basics, stuff that goes back all the way to the 1970s, and we’ll grow from there.</p>\n<h3>Why has Vim Survived?</h3>\n<p>Vim has been around for a while.  Originally released in 1991 as an improvement on vi (which had been around since 1976), it has outlasted a generation of programmers. The software world has changed a lot since 1991.  So why do people still use it?  </p>\n<p>Vim provides a system for editing text that is quite simply more powerful than its modern graphical based alternatives.  It asks a lot of its users. To use Vim effectively you have to internalize the syntax for many commands that have better affordances on other editors.  But you’re rewarded with a friction-free editing environment.  Vi’s commands are fast, composable, and powerful. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h3>Step 0: Setup</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is install a copy of Vim. If you’re on a Linux or Mac system, there is likely already a system copy, but it is probably not up to date.  So use your system’s package manager to get the latest version (7.4 at the time of this writing).  For Mac users I recommend using <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> to download <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a>. Windows users can download the latest executable on <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/download.php\">Vim.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The second thing you’ll need is a vimrc (the file vim uses for configuration).  These files can become quite extensive, setting up many different options, configurations, and plugins.  But we’re going to start simple.  Download <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">this minimal vimrc file</a> and install it in the appropriate directory for your OS as instructed.  If you already have a .vimrc file but don’t understand it, I’d recommend saving it elsewhere and using a minimal one for now. You can then build it out as you learn more.  </p>\n<h3>Step 1: Learn the Syntax</h3>\n<p>Just like a programming language, the first thing to learn for Vim is the basic syntax.  Vim has a built in tool to help you get comfortable called vimtutor.  It’s a text file set up to help you learn to navigate Vim. Once vim is installed you can run it by calling vimtutor on unix-style systems.  On Windows you can follow the instructions <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/270938/how-to-run-vimtutor-on-windows\">here</a>. It will take you through a series of 7 lessons that will familiarize you with the basic commands.</p>\n<p>Vim has rather non-standard commands, and it may be frustrating at first adapting to its different terminology and conventions.  The payoff comes slowly, but it does come.</p>\n<h4>Modes</h4>\n<p>The most important thing to understand is that Vim is a modal editor.  At any given time you’re in one of 6 modes.  You will have different abilities and keystrokes available to you in each of these modes.  For right now the key modes to understand are Normal Mode, Insert Mode, and Command line Mode.</p>\n<p>Normal Mode is the default mode.  It’s roughly equivalent to the state that other editors are in when you’re holding down the ctrl or cmd keys.  Instead of entering text onto the screen, different keys trigger different commands.  Initially this is a bit weird.  Those of us coming from other editors or IDEs are used to being able to type text by default.  The thought is that adding text is the primary task in a text editor.  But Vim treats adding text as sitting on equal footing with editing, deleting and manipulating existing text, and starts us in a mode where we can quickly make any change. To steal an analogy from Drew Neil, normal mode is the opportunity to take our paintbrush off the canvas while we decide our next stroke.  </p>\n<p>Insert mode is the equivalent of most editor’s normal state.  When you type a key in normal mode, it appears on the screen. You can enter insert mode by pressing <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> in visual mode, and exit it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Command line mode lets you enter ex-commands, a command line language that complements normal modes shortcuts.  You enter it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> in normal mode.  Important commands are <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code> to write (save) a file, and <code class=\"language-text\">:q!</code> to quit.</p>\n<p>The above commands, and an understanding of the modes are enough for you to survive in Vim, and treat it as a sort of awkward Notepad clone.  You can edit files, save them, and quit.  Going through vimtutor will introduce you to many more commands, and a few more modes.  But you can learn those at your own pace.  Right now you want to see what taking time to learn this awkward unfamiliar syntax can buy you.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Learn the Language</h3>\n<p>Vim’s key commands are different than you’ll find in other editors like Sublime Text.  They’re not a series of standalone actions that you can do one after another to get what you want.  Instead they form a language.  </p>\n<p>Vim statements are made up of actions and motions.  The actions are what you’re trying to do, the motions are where you want to do them.</p>\n<p>For example let’s take the <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> action. <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> deletes. You can delete a single character by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dl</code>.  You can delete 2 characters by typing <code class=\"language-text\">d2l</code>. You can delete a whole line by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, or delete inside a word by typing <code class=\"language-text\">diw</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you learn the d action, you can use it with every motion you know. Similarly, when you learn a new motion, you can then use it with every action you know.</p>\n<p>So if somebody shows me the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> action and tells me that it yanks (copies) text, I’ll know I can yank a character with <code class=\"language-text\">yl</code> a line with <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> and inside the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">yiw</code>.  Each new Vim command is a tool in your toolbox, and since the tools build off of each other they become exponentially more valuable.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Learn the Mindset</h3>\n<p>Vim can make you hyper-efficient.  But to get there you need to know more than just the command combinations available.  You have to shift your mindset.  Vim commands aren’t just easy to learn, they’re designed to be repeatable.  Bram Moolenar, Vim’s creator has listed out <a href=\"http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html\">7 habits of effective text editing</a>.  The second habit, don’t type it twice, is a pretty good summary of the “Vim Way” of doing things.</p>\n<p>Vim provides a bunch of ways to avoid repetition.  I’ll get into them in another post. For now though, let’s take a look at <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>, the dot command.  The dot command repeats the last action you’ve taken. For instance, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to change a word, hit <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code> to return to normal mode, then move to another word and type <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace that word as well.  You are able to avoid retyping the replacement word as well as the <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> command. You can run the whole replace with one keystroke, regardless of what words you’re replacing.  Like other Vim commands, the dot command is small on its own, but gains power as you add more tools to your toolbox.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<p>If you enjoyed this article you’ll probably also enjoy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356980&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS\">Practical Vim</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356980\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">: This amazing book by Drew Neil, the creator of <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/\">Vimcasts</a> was the single best resource I found as I learned Vim.

If you’re reading this blog, I bet you like it.  What if I told you your text editor could help you cut the amount of time you spend typing in half, with just a little reading and a bit of practice?  For you Vim users, it’s very possible that you’re spending way more time typing than needed.</p>\n<p>The software developers reading this have probably heard of the <em>Don’t Repeat Yourself</em> principle.  Developers want to avoid duplicating work, and try to write each distinct meaningful chunk of code only once.  DRY is extremely powerful when it comes to code, but it’s also a very useful principle in text editing.  Much of the editing work we do is extremely repetitive. Vim can help you remove those inefficiencies.</p>\n<p>If Vim’s composable commands are the <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language of Vim</a>, then repeating commands are it’s art.  For pretty much any thing you do in Vim, there are ways to automate and repeat it.  These “repeating commands” are powerful tools, but it’s not always easy to know what to do with them.  There aren’t simple rules you can learn for when to use repeating commands.  Instead it takes practice, awareness, and experience.  </p>\n<p>All of Vim’s commands are designed to be repeatable and undoable.  So if you find yourself typing something a lot, there is likely to be a good solution for making it easier and faster.  I’m going to lay out the tools for doing that, along with a few hints for knowing when to use them.</p>\n<h4>Repetition Basics: The dot command</h4>\n<p>The most important Vim tool for repetition is the dot command.  Pressing <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> at any time will repeat the last native command you used in Vim.  How is this useful?  Let’s say we’re faced with the following code</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> widget <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Widget</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> widgets <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">WidgetCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nwidgets<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>widget<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>widget<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'widget passed test'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If we want to rename the <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code> variable to be more informative, how could we go about it? We’ll ignore “language-wise” refactoring solutions, like <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">ternjs</a>, and look at the basic Vim options.  </p>\n<p>A simple find and replace causes problems.  We can’t distinguish between the widget we want and other occurences.  <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/widget/testWidget/g</code> results in plenty of unwanted changes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidget <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Widget</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidgets <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">WidgetCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ntestWidgets<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'testWidget passed test'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>It might be possible to find a complex regex that only hit the variables we want, but thats suddenly a lot of thought for what should be a simple change.

So what can we do?</p>\n<p>The dot command is a nice solution.  If we start on the first occurence of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to replace the current word with new text.  When we’ve added our new text and exit insert mode, we’ll have a <em>command</em>, which we can then repeat with <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>. After that we can move to the next occurence we want to change and hit <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace it without retyping the variable name.  If we accidentally use it in the wrong place, it’s easy to undo with <code class=\"language-text\">u</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course it would still be a pain to navigate between each widget with hjkl.  Fortunately, Vim has more commands that allow us to avoid unecessary work.  If we start on one instance of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> to search for all occurences of that word.  We can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> to move from occurence to occurence. If we overshoot and go too far, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> to go backwards.  So if we start with <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> (shift+8 in the gif below) and then use ciw to replace the word, we can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to clean up the other widgets in only 5 keystrokes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/vimdotcommand-fcd9036267e137c552c8afdc822b223f.gif\" alt=\"vim gif\"></p>\n<h4>The Vim Way</h4>\n<p>If you’re used to another editor, I’m guessing you’re justifiably a bit skeptical at this point.  After all, this example is something people do all the time, and many editors have tools to make it easy (multiple selections in Sublime Text and refactoring tools in language specific IDEs like Eclipse for instance).  They may take even fewer keystrokes than Vim. And they don’t require you to learn 6 separate commands to use well.  So what’s so special here?</p>\n<p>Let’s have a quick refresher on the philosophy of Vim.  Like the Unix ecosystem it came from, Vim provides <strong>small</strong>, <strong>composable</strong> tools that you can combine to create powerful actions.  The power isn’t in a specific use case.  Instead it comes from the range of possibilities that open up when we start mixing and matching the code.  As with verbs, movements, and text objects, repeating commands and their corresponding reverse commands are tools we can add to our toolbox.  Using the commands above and some of the other composable commands from my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language post</a>, we can do some cool things.</p>\n<p>We can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search through json files and selectively remove lines that contain an attribute we don’t want to use (start on the attribute, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly to select lines to delete)</li>\n<li>Replace a long, hard to type function name throughout the document with another version without having to type out the function name (start on the function name, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;newname&gt;/g</code>)</li>\n<li>Fix poorly indented lines using the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command (<code class=\"language-text\">&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;&lt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly, <code class=\"language-text\">u</code> to undo if you go too far. This can easily be used on groups of lines using visual mode too)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do all of these have in common?  They all use a command once, and a movement at most once, then allow for as much repetition as you like.

In many scenarios, once you’ve made a change and movement once, you can then get by with a single keystroke for each future action and movement, with another keystroke available to cancel an action if you go too far.  Here’s a partial list of repeating commands, with the corresponding cancel command to undo them.</p>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Repeating Command</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Canceling Command</th></tr>\n<tr><td>.</td><td>Repeat the last normal mode command</td><td>u</td></tr>\n<tr><td>n</td><td>Repeat the last Search</td><td>N</td></tr>\n<tr><td>;</td><td>Repeat the last character-wise search</td><td>,</td></tr>\n<tr><td>/<replacement>/</td><td>Repeat the last search</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@:</td><td>Repeat the last ex-mode command</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@@</td><td>Repeat the last Macro used</td><td>u</td></tr>\n</table>\n<p>None of these commands are all that useful on their own, but they’re each valuable things to learn as you build up your Vim toolbox. Focus on one or two to start, and learn to make edits so that you can easily repeat them. The art of Vim is learning to look for those opportunities, and crafting your commands so that they’re short, powerful, and repeatable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of you are probably confused that I wrote a whole post on repeating commands in Vim with only one side-reference to Macros.

One of the messiest parts of my transition to using Vim full time was its way of dealing with files.  Coming to Vim after primarily using Eclipse and Sublime Text, it frustrated me that Vim doesn’t bundle a persistent file system viewer, and the built-in ways of opening and switching files always felt extremely painful.  </p>\n<p>At this point I appreciate the depth of Vim’s file management features. I’ve put together a system that works for me even better than more visual editors once did. Because it’s purely keyboard based, it allows me to move through my code much faster.  That took some time though, and involves several plugins. But the first step was me understanding Vim’s built in options for dealing with files. This post will be looking at the most important structures Vim provides you for file management, with a quick peek at some of the more advanced features you can get through plugins.</p>\n<h3>The Basics: Opening a new file</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles to learning Vim is its lack of visual affordances.  Unlike modern GUI based editors, there is no obvious way to do anything when you open a new instance of Vim in the terminal.  Everything is done through keyboard commands, and while that ends up being more efficient for experienced users, new Vim users will find themselves looking up even basic commands routinely.  So lets start with the basics.</p>\n<p>The command to open a new file in Vim is <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code>.  <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> opens up a new buffer with the contents of the file inside. If the file doesn’t exist yet it opens up an empty buffer and will write to the file location you specify once you make changes and save. Buffers are Vim’s term for a “block of text stored in memory”. That text can be associated with an existing file or not, but there will be one buffer for each file you have open.</p>\n<p>After you open a file and make changes, you can save the contents of the buffer back to the file with the write command <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code>.  If the buffer is not yet associated with a file or you want to save to a different location, you can save to a specific file with <code class=\"language-text\">:w &lt;filename&gt;</code>. You may need to add a <code class=\"language-text\">!</code> and use <code class=\"language-text\">:w! &lt;filename&gt;</code> if you’re overwriting an existing file.</p>\n<p>This is the survival level knowledge for dealing with Vim files.  Plenty of developers get by with just these commands, and its technically all you need.  But Vim offers a lot more for those who dig a bit deeper.</p>\n<h3>Buffer Management</h3>\n<p>Moving beyond the basics, let’s talk some more about buffers.  Vim handles open files a bit differently than other editors.  Rather than leaving all open files visible as tabs, or only allowing you to have one file open at a time, Vim allows you to have multiple buffers open.  Some of these may be visible while others are not.  You can view a list of all open buffers at any time with <code class=\"language-text\">:ls</code>.  This shows each open buffer, along with their buffer number.  You can then switch to a specific buffer with the <code class=\"language-text\">:b &lt;buffer-number&gt;</code> command, or move in order along the list with the <code class=\"language-text\">:bnext</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bprevious</code> commands. (these can be shortened to <code class=\"language-text\">:bn</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bp</code> respectively).  </p>\n<p>While these commands are the fundamental Vim solutions for managing buffers, I’ve found that they don’t map well to my own way of thinking about files.  I don’t want to care about the order of buffers, I just want to go to the file I’m thinking about, or maybe to the file I was just in before the current one.  So while its important to understand Vim’s underlying buffer model, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend its builtin commands as your main file management strategy.  There are more powerful options available.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-8476c.jpeg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.15424164524421%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgADBP/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAeMoGkI//8QAGhABAQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACERIhIv/aAAgBAQABBQLk22MmcfT1F//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMRAR/9oACAEBAAY/AqylZzf/xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMZHB4f/aAAgBAQABPyF+8K62xVdBEgkoMT//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEHPP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPxA//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPxA//8QAGxAAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERMUGRUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8Qhj6ySu8eUs3sVscTl2IYll2ZPp//2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"splits example\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-6fbc3.jpeg\" srcset=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-da4c7.jpeg 143w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-1d39e.jpeg 285w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-6fbc3.jpeg 570w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-9d77e.jpeg 855w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-e356a.jpeg 1140w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-8476c.jpeg 1167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h3>Splits</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of managing files in Vim is its splits.  With Vim, you can split your current window into 2 windows at any time, and then resize and arrange them into any configuration you like.  Its not unusual for me to have 6 files open at a given time, each with its own small split of the window.</p>\n<p>You can open a new split with <code class=\"language-text\">:sp &lt;filename&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">:vs &lt;filename&gt;</code>, for horizontal and vertical splits respectively.  There are keyword commands you can use to then resize the windows the way you want them, but to be honest this is the one Vim task I prefer to do with my mouse.  A mouse gives me more precision without having to guess the number of columns I want or fiddle back and forth between 2 widths.  </p>\n<p>After you create some splits, you can switch back and forth between them with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-w [h|j|k|l]</code>.  This is a bit clunky though, and it’s important for common operations to be efficient and easy. If you use splits heavily, I would personally recommend aliasing these commands to <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-h</code> <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j</code> etc in your .vimrc using this snippet.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">nnoremap &lt;C-J&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-J&gt; &quot;Ctrl-j to move down a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-K&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-K&gt; &quot;Ctrl-k to move up a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-L&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-L&gt; &quot;Ctrl-l to move\tright a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-H&gt; &quot;Ctrl-h to move left a split</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h3>The jumplist</h3>\n<p>Splits solve the problem of viewing multiple related files at a time, but we still haven’t seen a satisfactory solution for moving quickly between open and hidden files.  The jumplist is one tool you can use for that.  </p>\n<p>The jumplist is one of those Vim features that can appear weird or even useless at first.  Vim keeps track of every motion command and file switch you make as you’re editing files.  Every time you “jump” from one place to another in a split, Vim adds an entry to the jumplist. While this may initially seem like a small thing, it becomes powerful when you’re switching files a lot, or moving around in a large file.  Instead of having to remember your place, or worry about what file you were in, you can instead retrace your footsteps quickly using some quick key commands.  <code class=\"language-text\">Ctrl-o</code> allows you to jump back to your last jump location.  Repeating it multiple times allows you to quickly jump back to the last file or code chunk you were working on, without having to keep the details of where that code is in your head. You can then move back up the chain with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-i</code>. This turns out to be immensely powerful when you’re moving around in code quickly, debugging a problem in multiple files or flipping back and forth between 2 files. Instead of typing file names or remembering buffer numbers, you can just move up and down the existing path.  It’s not the answer to everything, but like other Vim concepts, it’s a small focused tool that adds to the overall power of the editor without trying to do everything.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>So let’s be real, if you’re coming to Vim from something like Sublime Text or Atom, there’s a good chance all of this looks a bit arcane, scary, and inefficient.  “Why would I want to type the full path to open a file when Sublime has fuzzy finding?”  “How can I get a view of a project’s structure without a sidebar to show the directory tree?”  Legitimate questions.  The good news is that Vim has solutions.  They’re just not baked into the Vim core.  I’ll touch more on Vim configuration and plugins in later posts, but for now here’s a pointer to 3 helpful plugins that you can use to get Sublime-like file management.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is a fuzzy finding file search similar to Sublime’s “Go to Anything” bar.  It’s lightning fast and pretty configurable.  I use it as my main way of opening new files.  With it I only need to know part of the file name and don’t need to memorize my project’s directory structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is a “file navigation drawer” plugin that replicates the side file navigation that many editors have.  I actually rarely use it, as fuzzy search always seems faster to me.  But it can be useful coming into a project, when you’re trying to learn the project structure and see what’s available.  NERDTree is immensely configurable, and also replaces Vim’s built in directory tools when installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> is a code search plugin for Vim that allows you to search across your project for text expressions.  It acts as a light wrapper around Ack or Ag, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">2 great code search tools</a>, and allows you to quickly jump to any occurrence of a search term in your project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between it’s core and its plugin ecosystem, Vim offers enough tools to allow you to craft your workflow anyway you want.  File management is a key part of a good software development system, and it’s worth experimenting to get it right.</p>\n<p>Start with the basics for long enough to understand them, and then start adding tools on top until you find a comfortable workflow. It will all be worth it when you’re able to seamlessly move to the code you want to work on without the mental overhead of figuring out how to get there.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/seamlessly-navigate-vim-and-tmux-splits\">Seamlessly Navigate Vim &#x26; Tmux Splits</a> - This is a must read for anyone who wants to use vim with <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">tmux</a>.

Over the last 10 years, the JavaScript ecosystem has built up a rich set of tools to make your life easier.  Most of the buzz around tooling comes from browser devtools and the various build systems available for JavaScript projects, but you can also take advantage of improved tools within your code editor.  While there are some great IDEs for JavaScript development out there like WebStorm and Visual Studio, most JavaScript developers seem to prefer lighter-weight text editors.  So this post is going to be a quick look at the tools I use for more seamless JavaScript development in a text editor.</p>\n<h3>Basics</h3>\n<p>Before we get to anything JavaScript specific, there are a few important things to set up.  First, I’m assuming that you’re using a modern, extensible text editor. Those include, but are not limited to: <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\">Emacs</a>. There is great support for all of the below tips in each of these editors<sup id=\"fnref:0\"><a href=\"#fn:0\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition you should have</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reasonable default configurations<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>A fast system for navigating between files<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Great code searching<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">4</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re still working through those things, make sure to take the time to learn a bit more about your editor along with any JavaScript specific tools you use.  There’s a ton of efficiency you can gain from having those 3 things in place.</p>\n<p>Finally the first two tips below require <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">node.JS</a> and npm to be installed, as they rely on node libraries to function.  If you’ve never installed those before, the process is pretty painless.</p>\n<p>Once you have all of that in place, we can move on to other things.</p>\n<h3>Syntax Linting</h3>\n<p>JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly-typed language.  It is also written by human beings.  As a result, it can be easy to start running bad code without realizing that it has problems.  Some types of problems you’ll find out about quickly.  Bad syntax will halt program execution for instance.  But others will linger, subtly effecting logic or just making the code hard to understand for future developers (including yourself).   </p>\n<p>JavaScript linters (also called syntax checkers) can provide some of the safety of a compiler, and also help enforce a consistent set of styles to help maintain readability.  They are not magic.  JavaScript is still a weakly typed language with some weird syntactical sinkholes. It’s relatively easy to make logic mistakes if you’re undisciplined.  But linters are a great safety tool, especially for developers newer to JavaScript and its conventions.  Run as part of a build process, they can prevent you shipping bad code and help standardize conventions across a team</p>\n<p>While it’s a great idea to make linters part of your build process, you get even more power from integrating them with your editor.  Almost all modern text editors include some sort of plugin for displaying syntax errors and warnings in the gutter to the left of the text.  You can check out the integration pages for <a href=\"http://eslint.org/docs/integrations/\">ESLint</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/install/\">jsHint</a> to get a feel for the plugins available for your editor.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-141ef.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 82.47422680412372%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"linting picture\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-13239.png 855w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-141ef.png 970w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>TernJS + Autocomplete</h3>\n<p>Linters are great for telling you what not to do, but can’t give you much guidance on what you actually are able to do.  Fortunately we have other tools for that.  <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern.js</a> is a fantastic library that provides “intellisense” style autocompleting for JavaScript code, along with other IDE-like features including documentation links and refactoring support. It’s not perfect, since JavaScript’s nondeterministic syntax sometimes makes it hard to tell what properties a variable will actually have at runtime, but it takes a good shot at it and is able to go pretty far, especially for libraries where it can expose the full API to you within the editor.  To get the most out of Tern, you’ll need to set up a Tern project definition, where you can specify any files that you always want loaded, and any plugins you want to use. The preloaded files is useful if you’re making global references to a namespace or library, and the plugins can give you support for module systems, so that you can handle references that are passed into a module from a different file in code using requireJS or Angular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ternjs-46e25e5899958f3bd960e5692375a92b.gif\" alt=\"ternjs picture\"></p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>JavaScript development, especially on the front end, can involve a lot of repetitive boilerplate code<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">5</a></sup>.  Whether it’s module boilerplate like AMD require/define wrappers, library boilerplate like directive definitions in Angular or a Model definition in Backbone, or our own favorite patterns that we repeat a lot, we end up writing a lot of code over and over again.  Snippets are a great way to accomplish that.  They were one of the key features of Textmate when it first became popular.  Today they’re built in to Sublime Text and Atom, and there are popular libraries for both <a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet\">Emacs</a> to simulate the same functionality.</p>\n<p>Snippets allow you to define templates for common boilerplate code, allowing you to quickly insert repetitive content, including adding hooks for text that will vary across uses.  For instance here’s a snippet I have defined for creating a new AMD module<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#A new AMD define module\nsnippet dfn\ndefine([$1],function($2) {\n    $0  \n});\nendsnippet</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This allows me to type <em>dfn&#x3C;tab></em> at any time to expand out the template.  Initially my cursor will be in spot <code class=\"language-text\">$1</code>, and I can then enter text and tab to spot <code class=\"language-text\">$2</code>, with my final tab ending me at <code class=\"language-text\">$0</code>.  Snippet libraries can also provide other functionality like functions to show the current time, filename, or other contextual information.   Some can also mirror text so that you can enter a string once and have it appear throughout the template.  It can be a great time saver when you’re chugging through the boilerplate code of your project.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to implement JavaScript syntax checking definitely check out <a href=\"http://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/\">jsHint</a>.

It’s all about knowing which ones to use in which situations.  In my series from this summer on <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">learning Vim</a>, I focused a lot on the different tools Vim provides for solving problems.  Today I’ll show how I put some of those tools together to actually be more productive.</p>\n<p>A good tool should allow you to focus on your problem while using it, without making you spend a lot of time thinking about extraneous things. File switching is an area in text editing that can really slow you down if you let it.  The first file switching method that most Vim users is the simple <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command to open a file.  Technically it’s the only command you need for file switching, since you can use it to open up any file you want and start editing it.  But doing so requires you to essentially internalize the complete structure of your file system and type out full paths every time.  On a large project with nested directories that becomes a significant mental load and use of time, even if you’re taking advantage of Vim’s tab completion features. And it’s a mental load that’s inessential to the task at hand.  You need to recall the precise layout of your file structure every time only because the tool isn’t able to make things easier for you.</p>\n<p>Fortunately Vim is able to make easier things easier for you when you use the right tool for the job.  That means rather than using one file switching strategy to rule them all, we can combine several tools to reduce the mental load on us and focus on our code or writing. I’ll specifically look at a few common scenarios and my approach for each.  This isn’t the only workflow you can use to address these scenarios, but hopefully it will inspire you to improve your own Vim workflow.  So here are the different scenarios:</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file with a name I know</h4>\n<img src=\"ctrlp\" class=\"full-width\" alt =\"ctrlp screenshot\">\n<p>When you’re moving to a file with a name that you know, it’s hard to beat the power of a fuzzy finding plugin like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a>.  CtrlP allows me to type in the name of a file without remembering or typing a long directory path and instantly get a list of potential files.  Usually the file I’m looking for is the top hit.  </p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file, but I don’t know what it’s called</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-548f7.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75.6190476190476%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"NerdTree screenshot\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-13239.png 855w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-548f7.png 2100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>This scenario happens most often on projects that you’re unfamiliar with and just getting into.  You’re looking for some functionality, but don’t know exactly what it’s called within the project and need to look through the file system for hints.  In this case you need a directory browsing tool.  Vim bundles <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075\">netrw</a> by default and it’s a good starting place.  If you have issues with netrw, many people install <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a> as an alternative file explorer.  I personally don’t use NerdTree very often these days.  Most of my work over the last year or so has been on one large project or smaller experimental projects and I haven’t needed it.  But it’s been very useful when I’ve cloned down a github repository to look it over or make changes.  It’s the best way to quickly get the lay of the land of a project within Vim, and to find a specific file before you really know what you’re looking for.</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file that I already have open</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-157c6.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Buffer list\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-13239.png 855w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-157c6.png 2080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>A common scenario in Vim involves moving back and forth between 2 files, possibly a file and its corresponding test file.

If I have more than a few files open though I’ll usually either use <code class=\"language-text\">:b</code> and type the name of the file, or just use ctrlp again, which doesn’t require me to remember if the file I wasn’t is actually already open or not.</p>\n<h4>I want to move back to the place I just was</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6964c.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"indy\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6fbc3.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-da4c7.jpg 143w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-1d39e.jpg 285w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6fbc3.jpg 570w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-9d77e.jpg 855w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6964c.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>“Rabbit Holing” happens to me all the time when I’m working on code.  I start looking at one thing, then look at code related to that, and before I know it I’m 4 files deep following a chain of stuff I’m debugging.  Oftentime I want to move back up that chain.  I could of course remember what files I opened and use one of the methods above, but that requires me to internalize the memory of events.  The command that maps best to my desire to move back up the chain is using Vim’s jumplist.  Vim keeps track of every “jump” you make within a window or split, and allows you to move back up and down that jump list as you like, both within files and across them. The commands to move up and down the jump list are mapped to <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-o&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-i&gt;</code> by default.  When I use them I don’t have to keep track of what files I’m moving across or even if I’m switching files at all.  I can just investigate my issue and have confidence that I’ll be able to get back.  Think of it as tying down a rope before you dive into a cave full of snakes.</p>\n<h4>I want to create a new file</h4>\n<p>Creating a new file means that we finally find a use for the basic <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command.  Because you need to specify a full directory path anyway when you’re creating a file, it makes sense to use the basic Vim commands here.  If you need to create a directory to put the file in, you can use the shell command with <code class=\"language-text\">:!mkdir &lt;path/to/dir&gt;</code>.  While writing this piece I learned that ctrlp has the ability to create a new directory path and file in a single command, which is a nice touch.  But you lose out on Vim’s autocompletion of paths if you’re creating a directory nested in existing directories.  I find the builtins to be simplest here.</p>\n<h4>I want to edit a specific piece of code, but don’t know what file it’s in</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-ed99b.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.75988428158149%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Ag.vim\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-13239.png 855w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-ed99b.png 2074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>Finally, possibly the most common scenario for me is when I know I have a particular piece of code I need to edit, but don’t have it mapped to a particular file in my head.  Rather than forcing myself to recall the file, the easiest path is to let Vim take the information I know and help me out.  Specifically I use Ag.vim for code search within projects.  It is a wrapper around Ag, a <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">fantastic code search program based on Ack</a>.  It allows me to enter a search term, and then pulls up all occurrences of that term within my project.  One of it’s best features is filtering by file type, which allows me to type something like <code class=\"language-text\">:Ag --less &quot;\\.widget&quot;</code> and search my LESS files for all rules effecting the class <code class=\"language-text\">.widget</code>.  </p>\n<h3>Let Vim Work For You</h3>\n<p>The workflow I described is not the “one true way” to navigate files in Vim.  Some people hate plugins and will prefer to use <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:b</code>, and netrw for everything. You can certainly do many of the things above with NerdTree or CtrlP if you prefer to simplify to one tool.  And <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a> is an attempt to pull almost all of these scenarios into one tool.  The point is to be aware of the inessential work created in the different scenarios you face when coding and offload the work to Vim in a way that makes sense to you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/\">Oil and Vinegar</a> is a nice Vimcasts article on how to make NerdTree work well with multiple splits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I wrote a more <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/07/learning-vim-in-2014-working-with-files/\">introductory post</a> this summer on the tools you can use to manage files in Vim.

They’re a powerful tool, and a key part of what has helped Vim remain relevant for 23 years, even as the computing world has changed dramatically around it.  They allow Vim to support languages that didn’t exist the last time its core was updated, handle niche use cases that would never get solutions in the main Vim distribution, and also allow for powerful new features that benefit all users.</p>\n<p>Your key focus when it comes to Vim plugins should be identifying your needs and finding plugins to fit them.  Don’t just toss every plugin you see recommended somewhere into your .vim/bundle folder.  Plugins have costs; they slow down file loads, can fill up the key mapping space, and add complexity for users.  But they’re also extremely powerful, and I recommend that everyone who controls their development environment think about using at least a few.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Management: Hello Vundle</h3>\n<p>Before you install anything, you’re going to need a strategy for managing your plugins.  Plugin management for Vim has a bit of a troubled history.  There’s never been an official plugin management solution, and unlike Sublime Text’s Package Control, there wasn’t a simple, easy to use solution that the community standardized.  Instead, plugins were initially just placed into the .vim folder or elsewhere and then sourced in ~/.vimrc.  To allow for download or installation, authors used a variety of compression formats, including a Vim specific Vimball format.  Early efforts to standardize a process didn’t go particulary well.</p>\n<p>That changed with the rise of Github and Tim Pope’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a>.  Pathogen was the first plugin manager to make it relatively simple to include new plugins, by encouraging a standard directory format and installation process (using git repositories).  It began a standardization process that now means pretty much any modern Vim plugin can be installed with Pathogen without modification.</p>\n<p>Despite Pathogen’s historical significance, in 2014 you should use <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Vundle</a>, not Pathogen, to manage your plugins.  Vundle is an easy to use plugin manager that is compatible with the Pathogen format.  Vundle improves on Pathogen in several ways.  It allows you to list the plugins you want to use in your vimrc file, then will pull them down and install them for you.  So adding and removing plugins is just a configuration change, and it’s always easy to see which ones you’re currently using.  It makes it easy to pull plugins from a variety of sources, but optimizes for Github, and Vim.org.  Since roughly 99% of plugins that most users will need are available from one of those sources, this is extremely convenient.  You can find full documentation for using Vundle in its <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Github repo</a>, but trust me, it’s the best option out there for 99% of users.</p>\n<h3>What Can Plugins do for you?</h3>\n<p>Before you start installing plugins, it’s worth thinking about what you need from them.  There are a few main purposes for using plugins.  I’m including a few examples of each to get you started as you figure out which plugins make sense for you.</p>\n<h4>Let Vim Get Your Files In Order</h4>\n<p>File management plugins are some of the most important plugins you can use with Vim.  Vim’s built-in file management is pretty weak in some ways compared to editors like Sublime Text and TextMate.  Plugins can fill that gap.  The plugins listed below show several approaches to file management.  There’s plenty of overlap in functionality here, but they’re all worth trying to see which ones fit your style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is probably my most used Vim plugin.  It provides fuzzy finding capabilities for Vim, to allow you to search for files in a similar way to Sublime Text’s “Go To Anything” bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rking/ag.vim\">Ag.vim</a> are plugins to connect Vim with Ack and Ag respectively.  If you’re not using one of these tools for code search, you <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">really should be</a>.  They’re much faster than grep or an IDE’s built in search.  These plugins provide seamless integration for each within Vim, allowing you to easily jump to the code you’re searching on, opening new tabs or splits if you like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite.vim</a> is an interesting attempt to combine the functionality of plugins like ctrlp, ack.vim and others into a single “omnisearch” interface.  I personally found it a bit unintuitive and poorly documented, but some people <a href=\"http://www.codeography.com/2013/06/17/replacing-all-the-things-with-unite-vim.html\">swear by it</a>. If you are able to make sense of it, it’s certainly a great concept to pull in related functionality into a single interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is one of the most popular Vim plugins out there.  It provides a more traditional side-drawer style navigation interface to complement Vim’s other navigation options.  I personally prefer a “search over specifying” navigation style, so ctrlp and ack.vim work better for me.  But I keep NERDTree around for looking at other people’s code in new projects, when I want to look around a directory to see what’s available and how it’s structured before diving in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist\">Projectionist.vim</a> is something I’ve just begun to look into.  It’s an interesting approach by Tim Pope to provide a more intuitive way to navigate structured projects.  Rather than fuzzy finding or sidebars, Projectionist invites you to create categories of files that you can open files from (for instance  model, view and controller files in a BackboneJS project).  This gives you the simplicity of traditional Vim file path opens while removing some of the memorization and clutter from the process.  Projectionist also allows you to specify alternate files for each file. That allows you to, for instance, jump quickly from a file to its unit test file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Building On Vim’s Built In Language</h4>\n<p>Another interesting class of Vim plugins are plugins that extend Vim’s existing language concepts.  In my past few posts I’ve looked at how Vim is intended to be used by <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">combining composable commands with motions and text objects</a>, then efficiently <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">repeating that process when possible</a>.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround\">Surround.vim</a> is another plugin by Tim Pope.  It provides an extra command to use with Vim’s built in text objects. That command, <code class=\"language-text\">ys</code> allows you to surround a text object with some sort of enclosing tag. So <code class=\"language-text\">ysiw&#39;</code> surrounds the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">ysip&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</code> surrounds the current paragraph with <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags.  There’s also a separate command to replace surrounding characters with different ones.  It’s extremely useful, especially for HTML editing and quoting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary\">commentary.vim</a> adds a “commenting” action, <code class=\"language-text\">gc</code> that can be used with existing motions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">gcc</code> comments out the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">gcG</code> comments out the remainder of a file, and so on.  This is yet another Tim Pope plugin.  I promise I’m not trying to make up for recommending Vundle over Pathogen, the guy has just been prolific.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat\">Repeat.vim</a> is one final Tim Pope plugin for now.  Repeat allows you to extend the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command to work with user created commands.  It works with surround and commentary out of the box, but you can also set it up to work with your own commands. <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">The . command is one of the most important Vim commands</a>, so being able to use it in more situations is definitely a win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user\">vim-text-obj-user</a> is an interesting project to make it easy to create plugins that define custom text objects which then can be used with Vim commands like any other text object.  If that sounds scary to you, you can also take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user/wiki\">list</a> of plugins already built with the project, and use any that will be useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-4fae5.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.0145934676859%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Vim side by side styles\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-13239.png 855w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-4fae5.png 2878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h4>Help Vim Look Good</h4>\n<p>One of the best uses for plugins is making Vim a bit easier on the eyes. We can do a lot to change Vim’s default look and feel.  For instance the screenshot above shows what MacVim looks like with and without loading my ~/.vimrc file and plugins.  If you’re a writer or developer, you may be looking at Vim for as much as 8-10 hours a day.  So make it something you’re happy to look at.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Syntax highlighting plugins are one of the main things you can use to make your code easier to read.  Vim packages syntax highlighting for many common languages, but for less mainstream languages you’ll need to download plugins to get syntax highlighting.  These plugins often may contain other niceties for the language, like syntax checking or support for compiling from within Vim.  For instance I use plugins for <a href=\"https://github.com/groenewege/vim-less\">Less</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script\">CoffeeScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Colorschemes are also an important part of helping Vim look its best.  Most distributions of Vim bundle several colorschemes, but the most popular ones come as plugins.  If you’re somebody who needs to know that somebody else has sweated the details of the tools you use so that you don’t have to, I recommend <a href=\"http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\">Solarized</a>, a color scheme based on the relationships between different colors and designed to echo the readability of words on paper.  If you like to try different things and have more options, consider looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/chriskempson/base16\">Base16</a>, a project to standardize color scheme creation for multiple editors.  The advantage of both of these schemes is that they’re available for pretty much any editor or tool you’d want to use alongside or in place of Vim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Thematic</a> is a tool to allow you to manage your visual schemes.  So if you like to use different color schemes or fonts in different situations, Thematic can make that easy. You can define a set of “themes”, and then switch between them whenever you feel like it.  As somebody who uses Vim for both writing and programming, it’s nice to be able to use different themes for different situations.  I currently use Solarized for code, and the Pencil theme for writing.  Thematic and Pencil are two of a <a href=\"http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/reed-esau-s-growing-list-of-vim-plugins-for-writers\">wide variety of plugins for writers</a> that Reed Esau has written.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> is a plugin to pretty up your status bar.  It creates the nice triangular effects in the image above, and integrates with other plugins to show helpful information in the status bar.  It does require modified fonts to use though, so you’ll need to have pretty full control of the system you’re on to use this one.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Understand Your Code</h4>\n<p>Vim is not an IDE.  By default it doesn’t understand much about code, and very little about specific languages.  It offloads that knowledge to the operating system, through things like <code class=\"language-text\">:make</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ctags</code>, and to plugins.  Here are a few plugins that can help make Vim a bit more “code aware”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">Syntastic</a> is a syntax checking plugin for Vim that integrates with external syntax checkers to provide in-editor feedback on your code as you make changes.  For instance, it can integrate with jshint, llvm or javac to provide immediate feedback on a file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe\">YouCompleteMe</a> is a code completion engine for Vim that builds on Vim’s built in autocomplete features to offer “smart completion” for as many situations as possible.  It can integrate with Clang, Jedi, Omnisharp, and Vim’s omnicompletion in order to bring smart autocomplete to a variety of languages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive\">Fugitive</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter\">Git-gutter</a> are 2 plugins that bring Git integration into Vim.  Fugitive provides a wrapper around the Git executable to allow you to easily manage your git actions from within Vim. GitGutter focuses on individual files and lets you see where you’ve made uncommited modifications in the current file.  They complement each other well, and are both very useful for heavy Git users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate\">delimitMate</a> is a simple plugin that removes a huge annoyance by auto inserting matching braces and brackets in a smart, intuitive way.  Lack of auto brace insertion was a big mental hurdle for me coming from Sublime Text.  DelimitMate makes things work the way I expect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language specific plugins are another plugin group worth investigating.  There are way too many examples to list here, but one that I use and enjoy is <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">TernJs</a>, a code intelligence plugin for Javascript that you can use with something like YouCompleteMe to get the type of IDE style autocompletion that is very rare for Javascript code.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Play Nice With Others</h4>\n<p>Some plugins exist to provide tighter integration between Vim and external programs.  We’ve already touched on a few of those, like Ack.vim and Syntastic.  Vim is intended to follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well and working well with other programs.  Integration plugins allow for deeper versions of that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator\">Tmux Navigator</a> is a must have plugin for <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">Tmux</a> users.  It allows you to easily move between tmux and Vim splits using a single set of keyboard mappings.  It lets Vim and tmux work together in a completely natural way, without the user having to keep track of where one ends and the other begins.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash.vim</a> is an OSX only plugin that provides integration with Dash.app, a documentation manager app for OSX, making it easy to look up library method definitions from within Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Grant Vim Superpowers</h4>\n<p>The last category of plugins are scripts that allow Vim to do things that are totally different than anything it can do on its own.  These may be features pulled from other editors, or features inspired by Vim but implemented differently than the Vim core.  These can be pretty amazing, but I’d be careful with them to start.  You’ll want to learn how Vim works before piling a bunch of big extensions on top of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Ultisnips</a> allows Vim to use Textmate like “snippets” that allow you to save canned templates of code or text, then insert and modify them whenever you’re ready.  If this sounds interesting, I’d recommend checking out the recent <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-ultisnips/\">Vimcast</a> episodes where Drew explores Ultisnips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion\">EasyMotion</a> is a plugin that introduces a new type of movement to Vim.  It creates alternative versions of the Vim movements like <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">w</code> that allow you to find a character or word anywhere on the screen, and specify it by using a key character that temporarily appears on the screen in place of each possible target character.  If that’s hard to follow, check out the <a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d5f800b9602faaeccc2738c302776a8a11797a0e/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f333739373036322f323033393335392f61386539333864362d383939662d313165332d383738392d3630303235656138333635362e676966\">demo</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimawesome.com/\">VimAwesome</a> is a recent project to collect popular Vim plugins in a beautiful, searchable format.

I’m going to limit myself to listing 5 of the most useful for Javascript development, but its definitely worth looking around at the options to find more that fit what you want to do.</p>\n<h3>#1. Package Control - The Essential Plugin</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\">Package Control</a> is the very first package anyone should install for Sublime Text.  It makes it easy to install any other package without having to clone Git repositories or work through Sublimes file structure.  And the author has made it relatively easy to install Package control as well.  All that is required is a quick copy and paste of code provided on the developers website.  Package control makes it easy to install new packages, snippets, themes, and color schemes.</p>\n<h3>#2. Sublime Linter - Write Better Code</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter\">Sublime Linter</a> is a code quality tool for Sublime Text that makes it easy to find and fix code that doesn’t meet the standards that you define.  For javascript code you can choose to use jsHint<a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/\">jshint</a> or jsLint<a href=\"http://www.jslint.com/\">jslint</a>, the two most popular javascript linters.  I highly recommend this package.  It places a border around lines that are non-conformant with a message in the bottom border of the editor, but otherwise stays out of your way.  It makes it easy to fix code issues as you’re editing, rather than waiting till the end and getting a huge error dump when you run your code through the linter.</p>\n<h3>#3. Emmet - Get Through The Boilerplate</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.emmet.io/\">Emmet</a> is a tool for web developers that allows you to use CSS style prefixes to quickly generate html code.  It allows quick generation of boilerplate HTML with a familiar syntax, so you can focus on code instead of markup.  The github project for the package is <a href=\"https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime\">here</a></p>\n<h3>#4. Git - Take Control Of Your Project Inside Your Editor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> has rapidly become the go to version control system for open-source projects, and is also used by many private organizations and individual developers.  If you’re using Git to manage your javascript projects, you should definitely install the <a href=\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki\">git package</a> for Sublime Text.  Its not a command line replacement, some commands move much slower than it would with command line, but it allows the convenience of using common commands like add, diff, and blame from within your editor.</p>\n<h3>#5. Clipboard History - Improve your clipboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-clipboard-history\">Clipboard History</a>  is a nice little utility that lets you see the recent history of your clipboard.  It only works for snippets copied from within Sublime Text, but its a nice little tool for refactoring, when you’re moving code around quickly and want to delete something without losing it completely.</p>\n<h3>Find your own</h3>\n<p>In the end different packages work for different people.  I highly recommend installing Package Control and browsing around through the options.  If you find a great package, leave a comment here and let me know.  There are a lot of packages out there, and everybody’s needs are different</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/03/sublime-text-for-javascript-plugins"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-art","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":"vim-language","title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language","description":"An explanation of the grammar behind Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language","date":"2014-07-02T11:27:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if your text editor just did what you said instead of making you slowly and manually add and delete characters?  Vim doesn’t speak English, but it has a language of its own, built out of composable commands, that is much more efficient than the simple movement and editing commands you’ll find in other editors.  In my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">last post</a>, I took an initial look at Vim as a language.  I’m going to dive deeper into that here.</p>\n<h3>Vim Verbs: What can you do?</h3>\n<p>Vim’s “verbs” mostly fall into 2 main categories.  Some of them act on a single character, and others act on a “motion” or “text object”.  We’ll look at motions in a second, but lets start by looking at the verbs.</p>\n<h4>Single character verbs</h4>\n<p>So like I said, there are a few vim actions that act on a single character.  They act as shortcuts for actions that you can also perform with motions, and allow you to save a few keystrokes.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>Delete character under the cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>r</td><td>Replace character under cursor with another character</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>s</td><td>Delete character under cursor and move to insert mode</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These are great commands to know, and things that I use daily, but they act as a bit of an island.  Let’s look at some verbs with more power.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>d<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>c<motion></td><td>Delete text specified by motion and go into insert mode</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>y<motion></td><td>Yank (copy) text specified by motion</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>These aren’t the only 3 actions that you can use with motions, but they’re probably the most important. The first 2 are roughly the same as deleting or cutting in most instances, with the option to choose what mode you end in. The 3rd is Vim’s version of copying.</p>\n<h4>Motions</h4>\n<p>So how do we use these actions?  You’ll notice that if you type any of the above characters into Vim by themselves, nothing happens.  That’s because they’re expecting something to act on.  If you’re a grammar nerd or remember your 8th grade english classes, you can think of these as transitive verbs that need to act on a direct object.  These “direct objects” come in 2 forms, motions and text objects.  Motions are the motion commands that you can use at any time to move around Vim.  Some examples:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Motion</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the line</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>G<motion></td><td>Go to the end of the file</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>f.<motion></td><td>Go to the next occurrence of `.` on the current line</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>All of these commands work as motions on their own, but when you combine them with actions you can get powerful effects.  So <code class=\"language-text\">d$</code> means “delete to the end of the line”.  <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> means “change through the next closing parentheses” and <code class=\"language-text\">yG</code> means copy everything through the end of the file.  The list above is only a small subset of the motions available.  I’d suggest learning 1 or 2 to start and using them when appropriate.  As you get more comfortable with Vim you can continue to add more, and each one will unlock a set of commands for all of the actions you know.</p>\n<p>The second type of “direct object” that Vim verbs can take is a text object.  You can think of text objects as a “defined chunk of text.”  Some examples include selecting words, html tag contents, or the contents of a function.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Text Object</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iw</td><td>Applies to everything in the current word</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>it<motion></td><td>Applies to everything in current xml/html tag</td>\n</tr><tr>\n<td>i{<motion></td><td>Applies to everything inside nearest curly brackets</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>So using text objects you can change the contents of a word with the easily memorizable <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> (change in word), or copy the contents of an html <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with yit.  It’s worth mentioning here that one of the most powerful text objects is a bit of an oddball.  A really common thing people do is applying an action to the current line.  Vi’s language makes this easy by allowing the shortcut for this text object to be a simple repeat of the action.  So <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> yanks the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> deletes it, and <code class=\"language-text\">cc</code> changes it.</p>\n<h4>Piece by Piece</h4>\n<p>The key here is that learning Vim isn’t something you do in a weekend. It’s an iterative process. Since the actions, motions, and text objects build on themselves, you can start to grow your toolbox exponentially as time goes on.  But you’ll want to start with a few commands that you find make you productive.  I’ve personally found <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ci(</code> to be incredibly useful commands, and a great place to start as you learn to use these commands instead of the slower “mouse and select” methods that you may be used to. When we learn languages we all start with basic sentences, learn the grammar rules and grow from there.  Vim is no different. Start small and add to your toolbox as you build great things with it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/1424361\">Your problem with Vim is that you don’t grok vi</a> - A concise explanation of what makes vi/vim special, and one of the most popular answers ever on Stack Overflow.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1\">Why Atom can’t replace Vim</a> - A great piece on the big picture importance of composable commands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/\">Vim Text Objects: The Definitive Guide</a> - This is a nice rundown of the different text objects available, including some that you can add using plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4>Update</h4>\n<p>This post is currently on the front page of Hacker News.

I don’t completely love it.  There are elements (startup speed, maturity of some core editing components, not being able to run it in a terminal) that I miss from my experiences with Vim and/or Sublime Text.  I’m using Atom though because the core editing experience is now “good enough” and the way the editor is built allows for some very cool and unique experiences.  Atom (like <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>) is built on <a href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\">Electron</a>, Github’s JavaScript environment for building desktop apps.  Because it is built with web technologies and was designed from the beginning to be extensible, it is much easier for most developers to build rich visual extensions on top of Atom that provide unique UIs for editor functions than it is in Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs or an IDE.

There are similar projects for Sublime Text and Vim that look at color names in a CSS or LESS file and highlight them with the color they represent.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-74753.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 108.77914951989027%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"pigment-preview\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-13239.png 855w,\n/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/color_less_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1066e190f183df795921a746101a2b1a-74753.png 1458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>But Pigments does much more than that.  In addition to highlighting text, Pigments searches your project and creates a directory of all the colors used in your projects.  You can look through your palette and quickly go to the definition of any individual color.  Because pigments tracks everything, it can highlight LESS/SCSS variables as well as plain color names, even if those variables were originally defined in a different file.  Pigments also hooks into Atom’s autocomplete, and displays a preview of the color options when autofilling colors.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-4e85e.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 78.69934024505183%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Pigments project\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-13239.png 855w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/Palette_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom_and_Editor_-_benmccormick_org-d326da676a7c3fa39fdfb5e3a74b8139-4e85e.png 2122w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>It is a rich way of managing colors for a whole project, the best way of seeing at a glance every color used in your CSS project that I’ve ever seen.</p>\n<h3>Expose</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/expose\">Expose</a> is a file management tool modeled after Mac OSX’s expose feature.

First, autocomplete plus has flexible visual context options, allowing autocomplete providers to show the type of the autocomplete option, a brief description, and potentially a more in depth description.  So users can distinguish between (for instance) completions offering a snippet, a function, a keyword, or an import.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-11221.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.07629427792916%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"autocomplete-plus\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-13239.png 855w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-f7bd823fd1cf6230818b867937150556-11221.png 1468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>Autocomplete-plus is also a great example of the flexible nature of Atom.  Because Atom itself is made up of packages, with a very small core package, it’s easy to replace key parts of the editor like the auto-complete package with a community version.  And if that version ends up being better in the long run, it’s possible to pull that into the editors core, as happened with autocomplete-plus.</p>\n<h3>Todo-show</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/todo-show\">Todo-show</a> is a cool little package that searches your project for comments containing TODO, FIXME, CHANGED, REVIEW and other configurable comment strings, and lists them as a table.  It’s a simple idea that formalizes something that many developers do all the time.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-0e39a.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.18546365914787%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"todo-show\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-13239.png 855w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-1-c96256111971e5c0d8ceac160ec20b8a-0e39a.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Twitter has pointed out this even crazier riff on this concept that I’d seen a while ago but had been unable to find when I dove back into Atom.  <a href=\"http://imdone.io/\">Imdone</a> is a trello-like experience in the editor for managing todos.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336\">@ben336</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtomEditor\">@AtomEditor</a> You might also like imdone-atom.

But rather than being limited to the line-by-line gutter warnings or showing collections of warnings through awkward use of UI elements meant for a different purpose, Linter shows you a live collection of errors at the bottom of the file and lets you easily switch back and forth between that and errors for all open project files.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-4d321.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 97.26027397260275%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAATCAIAAAAf7rriAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABx0lEQVQ4y+2U646bMBCFeZ42GwwY4wu2wTcg3NJkt03zv+oDVOrzd0x2VaWX3T5ApaPRSPibGdvHJO9TusdqT/QuEw9YFpUmRKGcv0vZPq/TQsKCXcogQVjuECfUNDL4dlC1TxBuMzkW7VLpqfYnZVfrFt1ORT0w5gRztXCCO84sYzYndo/blDjpj0R0SVaagndUT7yZ63YpRY/lwFXPVE94l2ITq5cgA0KbIMHMg5KCGMKC9qdu/tzNF+8XbRbsP8hwlLoXquOygybohbwJRsgrmyBiUawUhB5qUDOUciBqpHUPnzF1RRXX/QLfFMcuWSg51LZo2xLEDADiEDbppj+SEa6oZTxwdzT9UxtOopky0VdqFGrMiP0b9rNzQT2iPmMBEhgBQw4jFM3rZIRhZm5W0sy5PMSG7SzNSuWQxSNx+bbh3/XSGXZI4n2A0qgGekLyZtsI/8ui//A9DK56eD7qO70NgzEoD3RzCFwsRPA5vARwy81hrxRKuD9/O1+/z4/NdA2HT9odW3/yhyfXPzI1EtFzPcp2YepwR26+SIQ/f10vX/rVjJdpucKThv+BaGauJ4i2O4fxozIrjPNsJyBhospllfsBiUgFS2sYW18AAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"linter\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-13239.png 855w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/frequency_cap_es6_-__Users_Ben_Code_Windsor_wcui_dev_src_wcui_-_Atom-2-ba4861e9f9ce9f39bd0f22721ff78fc4-4d321.png 1606w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h3>git-time-machine</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/littlebee/git-time-machine\">git-time-machine</a> is the newest package on this list.

I’ve been using it as my primary editor for a year and a half, and have picked up some tips along the way that I thought were worth sharing.  These tips assume that you have at least a passing familiarity with Atom: they’re the things that I’ve picked up over time that have made me more productive.</p>\n<h4>1. There is more to the Fuzzy Finder than meets the eye</h4>\n<p>Fuzzy finders have been a key feature on modern editors since TextMate first popularized the ⌘T command<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> for searching through project files.  ⌘T (or ⌘P) still works great in Atom, but what you may not know is that Atom provides 2 other versions of the command. ⌘B searches only among currently open files.  ⇧⌘B searches only among files that are “dirty” according to git<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.  Both of those options are built in.  You can also find other uses for the fuzzy-finder if you start exploring plugins, including <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-fuzzy-grep\">atom-fuzzy-grep</a>, a plugin that lets you use the fuzzy-finder interface to search file contents using grep, <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2016/04/30/ack-tips/\">ack</a>, ag, or ripgrep.</p>\n<h4>2. Atom is a great Vim replacement</h4>\n<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you know I’ve written a lot about <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">Vim</a>.  I still love the <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">philosophy of Vim</a>, and think that the text editing <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language</a> it implements is the best way to edit code quickly.  But Atom’s <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus\">vim-mode-plus</a> is the best vi implementation I’ve seen outside of Vim, and unlike other editors, you don’t need to get frustrated with a halfway approach to Vi-keybindings, since you can make pretty much everything work in a vim-like way.  That’s because:</p>\n<h4>3. Atom’s keybindings are powerful and flexible</h4>\n<p>Any command exposed by the core editor or a plugin in Atom can be bound to a keyboard shortcut.  None of the default commands are hard-coded, and the editor provides powerful contexts for controlling what keys have lead to what action when.  That means if I want to use <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j/k/l/h</code> to control my navigation between split panes, but also use <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j/k</code> to move up and down in the autocomplete widget, I can just add these lines to my <code class=\"language-text\">keymap.cson</code> file</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token string\">'atom-text-editor, body'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-k'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-above'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-j'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-below'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-h'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-on-left'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-l'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'window:focus-pane-on-right'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token string\">'body atom-text-editor.autocomplete-active'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-k'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'autocomplete-plus:move-up'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'ctrl-j'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'autocomplete-plus:move-down'</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Different commands are triggered in different context.  You can also take advantage of this with vim-mode to have “normal mode only” keyboard shortcuts like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token string\">'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus.normal-mode'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'] b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'pane:show-next-item'</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'[ b'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'pane:show-previous-item'</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That implements a behavior I’d missed from Vim’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired\">unimpaired plugin</a> of moving between open files with <code class=\"language-text\">[b</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">]b</code>.</p>\n<h4>4. Make sure to sync your settings</h4>\n<p>One area where Atom is less ideal than Vim is setting portability.  It doesn’t have a single file where all configuration is stored, or a nice settings folder that can be synced.  Instead settings are intermingled with other data in a <code class=\"language-text\">~/.atom</code> folder, a fact that is obscured by the editor’s UI, which attempts to put a nice UI in front of all of these setting files and steer you away from editing them directly or caring about where they’re stored.  Which works great until you need to move your config to a new machine or sync between 2 machines.  </p>\n<p>Fortunately, there’s a great plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/atom-community/sync-settings\">sync-settings</a> that makes this simple.  It does require setting up a gist to serve as your repo, but after that the process is painless and allows you to continue on unaware of the implementation details behind settings.</p>\n<h4>5. Check Timecop and clean up plugins that you’re not using</h4>\n<p>Atom is built on web technologies.  This is both the best and worst thing about Atom.  It leads to its greatest strengths: hackability, a focus on UX early on since they didn’t have to build a whole UI engine from scratch, and quick iteration.  But it also has very real tradeoffs, the biggest of which are battery life and startup performance<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.  There’s not much to be done about the battery life drain; Atom is based on Chromium, and Chromium is a battery hog.  It is simply a tradeoff to understand when choosing an editor.  But startup performance is often greatly influenced by the packages that you choose to use.  Fortunately Atom includes a simple tool for tracking this called Timecop.</p>\n<p>You can find Timecop in the command palette (⇧⌘P by default).  When you run it, Timecop displays a report of all of your packages and themes and how they contribute to startup time.  It will look something like this:</p>\n<p>\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-0167c.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 65.93673965936739%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"screenshot of timecop\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/timecop-e54c55880eb9aea6f4fa92ea3c8409a0-0167c.png 822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I wouldn’t recommend obsessing too much over timecop.  For most packages the benefit you receive is going to significantly outweigh any startup burden.  But if your editor starts to feel sluggish, this is a great first step to figuring out if there’s anything you can drop to make an impact.</p>\n<h4>6. The UI is just HTML and CSS, and that means you can edit it</h4>\n<p>Everything you see in an Atom UI is an HTML element, with classes that you can use to select and style them. This fact is mostly relevant when creating themes, but you can also use it to make one-off UI adjustments.  For instance, when I edit Markdown files, the <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig\">editorconfig</a> plugin I have installed warns me about a possible conflict with another atom package. The warning shows up as a small colored mouse icon in the status bar.</p>\n<p>\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-7a88b.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 44.88567990373045%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"screenshot of editorconfig mouse icon in the status bar\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/editor-mouse-39200e898c084d11c48d6b6d7da6471e-7a88b.png 831w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I find this warning distracting.  I know what its there for and have decided I don’t care about it, but I can’t dismiss it normally.  So instead I can take advantage of Atom’s flexibility to just get rid of it.

I’ve been using <a href=\"https://atom.io\">Atom</a> as my primary text editor for a year and a half now, but I still occasionally play with other editors and keep up with their updates.  There are a crazy number of good cross platform editors these days, and they all have a bunch of good ideas that get shared and remixed across each other. This week Sublime Text came out with a new release <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev\">Dev Build 3132</a> that included 3 new color schemes.  One of them was Mariana, which I believe is a variation on the also great <a href=\"http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/\">Oceanic Next</a>, with possibly some influences from my previous favorite dark theme <a href=\"https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme\">Tommorrow Night Eighties</a> <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.

I built on the work of the great <a href=\"https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax\">atom-material-syntax</a> package to build out a new theme.  It turns out to be surprisingly easy to build a color scheme in Atom.  Fork an existing theme, change some colors and the details in package.json, delete a bunch of git tags <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, and then run <code class=\"language-text\">apm deploy minor</code>, and you’re in business.  </p>\n<p>You can now download <a href=\"https://atom.io/themes/mariana-syntax\">mariana-syntax</a> in Atom.  This was a quick port.  I’ll be working to optimize it for the languages I use (JS, Python, CSS/Less, HTML and Markdown) over the next few weeks.  I would love to see pull requests for other languages or for anything that I’ve missed so far.

Sublime Text gives you a ton of power without ever touching\nyour mouse.  It takes a little while to get up to speed with its way of doing things, but the\nmore you use these shortcuts, the more you want to use Sublime Text.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: I will be using windows based commands for these examples.  In general they are the same for linux, and similar for OSX, with command replacing ctrl, and alt replacing shift in some cases.</strong></p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<h4>Ctrl + P  (Go To Anything)</h4>\n<p>We’re starting with the best here.  Ctrl + P opens up “Go To Anything”.  This allows for\nfuzzy search with Google Instant style results from among all open files and files in your current project.</p>\n<p>So you could start typing “mpag” and the editor would instantly load up mainPage.html into your editor pane, while showing a list of possible hits in your command palette, with a score next to them showing the confidence level of the match.  The speed of this feature is amazing.</p>\n<p>The real power of Go To Anything though comes when you combine it with subcommands.\nGo To Anything supports 3 subcommands</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@</strong> - this lets you specify a function within the file that you want to go to.  This can\nalso be fuzzy-matched, so chb@setbg might take you immediately to the setBackground\nmethod of the chartbuilder.js file.</li>\n<li><strong>:</strong> - this lets you go to a line by number.  So chb:100 will take you to line 100 of chartbuilder.js</li>\n<li><strong>#</strong> - this lets you search for a string in the file so chb#extend will take you to\nthe first occurence of “extend” in Chartbuilder.js.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use these subcommands by themselves (Ctrl+ subcommand) to navigate within the current file.</p>\n<p>After you’ve found the location you want, you can hit enter and begin editing immediately.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + alt + P (Switch Project)</h4>\n<p>Sublime Projects are a powerful way to organize your work.  Switching projects allows\nyou to instantly open all windows that you had left open the last time you used the project.\nThis gives you the ability to instant switch between work-items without losing momentum\ngetting things set up the way you want.  ctrl + alt + P lets you switch projects within\nyour current window.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + shift + P (Command Palette)</h4>\n<p>Sublime’s Command Palette probably deserves its own article.  But in essence this\nis the easiest way to control plugins, and also holds shortcuts for several of the lesser used\ncommands like setting syntax and controlling bookmarks.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + PgUp, Ctrl + PgDown (Switch Files)</h4>\n<p>These let you switch between your open files.  There are also Ctrl+tab and Ctrl+shift+tab, which are listed as\nnext file in stack and previous file in stack.  I have seen no difference between the behavior of these two\nsets of commands.  If anybody knows the difference, please enlighten me in the comments.</p>\n<h4>F2 and variants (Bookmark Commands)</h4>\n<p>Sublime Texts bookmarks make it easy to move to predetermined locations in the file.  Bookmarks are set to a specific location in the file. There are several shortcuts associated with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + F2</strong> - Toggles a bookmark from the current location.</li>\n<li><strong>F2</strong> - Go to next bookmark</li>\n<li><strong>Shift + F2</strong> - Go to previous bookmark</li>\n<li><strong>Alt + F2</strong> - puts a cursor at each bookmark location</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + F2</strong> - Clear all bookmarks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Search Commands</h4>\n<p>Sublime Text has a fairly standard set of search commands, with a few special twists</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + F</strong> - Search</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + F</strong> - Search in other files (gives a listing of all findings in a new file, you can use f4 to iterate over the results within their files)</li>\n<li><strong>F3</strong> - Find Next</li>\n<li><strong>Shift + F3</strong> - Find Previous</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + H</strong> - Replace</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + E</strong> - Search for current selection</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A few more minor shortcuts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + M</strong> - Go to a matching bracket.  Goes to the end of the innermost set of brackets if not currently on a bracket.</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K then Ctrl + C</strong> - Scrolls to move cursor to center of the screen</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selection and Multiple Cursors</h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful features of Sublime Text is its ability to easily select and manipulate text, especially\nthe way it can use multiple cursors simultaneously</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + D (Multiple Selection)</h4>\n<p>One of the cooler features of sublime text is its multiple selection option.  When you have some selected text,\nentering Ctrl+D selects the next instance of that selection.  You can do this repeatedly.  If you want to skip an instance\nyou can just hit Ctrl + K and then Ctrl + D again.  You can then edit all of the selections together, or use the multiple selections to make further changes.  The Esc key lets you go back to a single selection.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + L (Select Line)</h4>\n<p>I use this one all the time.  Allows you to select the entire line the cursor is on.  Combined with Ctrl + D you can select\nevery line a selection appears on.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Shift + L (Split Selection into lines)</h4>\n<p>Splits a multiline selection into individual line selections, giving you a cursor for each line</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + alt + Up/Down (Add a new line with a cursor)</h4>\n<p>Adds a new line above or below the current line with an additional cursor at that line.\nLets you quickly start multiple lines with the same content</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + D Select Current Word</h4>\n<p>Expands the selection to the current word</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Shift + Space - Expand selection to current block</h4>\n<p>The name of this feature in Sublime Text is “Expand selection to current scope”,\nbut thats misleading for javascript, which does not have block scope.  There are\na few more of these commands, but this and Ctrl + Shift + M (which appears to behave identically)\nare the relevant commands for Javascript.  Ctrl + Shift + A expands to tag for HTML.</p>\n<h3>Editing</h3>\n<h4>Ctrl + / (Add Comment)</h4>\n<p>If you add a shift it makes a block comment.</p>\n<h4>Ctrl + Enter (Move to a new line)</h4>\n<p>Moves to a new line below the current line.  Ctrl + Shift + Enter moves to a new line above the current line</p>\n<h4>Delete shortcuts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + del</strong> - Delete word forward (removes the rest of the word from cursor)</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + backspace</strong> - Delete word backward</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + K</strong> - Delete Line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K, Ctrl + K</strong> - Delete Line forward</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + K, Ctrl + backspace</strong> - Delete line backwards</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Mark Commands</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + space</strong> - Add a mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + A</strong> - Select to mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + W</strong> - Delete To mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + X</strong> - Switch Location with mark</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + k then Ctrl + G</strong> - Clear Mark</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Some Quickies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + ]</strong> - Indent a line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + [</strong> - Unindent a line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + shift + up/down</strong> - Swap a line upwards/downwards</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + J</strong> - join line with next line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + D</strong> - Duplicate line</li>\n<li><strong>Ctrl + T</strong> - Transposes the letter/word prior to the cursor with the one after.  I’ve never actually found a use for this in my js coding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Finding The Power</h3>\n<p>Of course the real power of these shortcuts happens when you start using them for real things and combining them together.\nHere are a few real life examples of ways sublime text can speed up everyday javascript coding.</p>\n<h4>Creating a Javascript array from a CSV</h4>\n<p>If you have a CSV full of data that you want to convert into a 2d js array, you can simply select the whole area,\nuse Ctrl + Shift + L, hit end to move to the end of the lines, insert a ”],” then hit home and add ”[” to the start of each line.\nFinally hit escape, then [ to surround the selection with brackets.  Finally hit the right arrow to move to the end of the selection\nand move back to delete the trailing comma.  The whole transformation can be done with 10 keystrokes.</p>\n<h4>Renaming a variable or function</h4>\n<p>This is an obvious one, but Ctrl + D allows you to easily select every instance of a selection.  You can switch over “false positives” with Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D</p>\n<h4>Code Formatting</h4>\n<p>Want to move your curly brackets to a new line after the expression?  Ctrl +D all ”){” instances then move left and enter.  You can move it back by selecting the plain { and using backspace, though you may need to skip some.  Fixing indentation is easy with Ctrl + [ and ctrl + ].</p>\n<h4>Editing in 2 functions</h4>\n<p>If you’re working on 2 functions, bookmarks can be great ways to easily navigate back and forth between 2 (or more sections of code)</p>\n<h3>This is just the start</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text is what you make of it.  If you use it regularly I suggest that you learn to use it well.\nYou don’t need to learn all the shortcuts, but find a few that work for you and make you a faster, more efficient coder.</p>\n<p>If you have suggestions for other great uses of keyboard shortcuts in Sublime Text, please leave them in the comments.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Text Editors","Sublime Text"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Sublime Text For Javascript: Configuration","description":"Helpful configuration options for JS developers","layout":"post","path":"/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration","date":"2013-01-01T18:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’m starting a new series of posts on Sublime Text, and how to get the most out of the editor.\nThe series will be focused on Javascript development, as that is how I use Sublime Text, but it should be applicable to any developer who uses Sublime Text as part of their workflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Keyboard Shortcuts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/01/03/sublime-text-for-javascript-plugins\">Sublime Text For Javascript: Packages</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text allows for plenty of text editing power out of the box, but the real power comes\nwhen you begin configuring it to meet your own needs.  This is by definition a topic that different people will approach in different ways, but in this post I will attempt to give an overview of what is configurable in Sublime Text (<strong>Spoiler: almost everything</strong>), and how to configure them.</p>\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n<p>Sublime Text settings are defined using json files.  There are multiple levels of configuration\nto give you very fine grained control of how your editor will act for different files.\nFrom the <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/settings.html\">Sublime Docs</a>,  settings are prioritized like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Settings files are consulted in this order:</p>\n<p>Packages/Default/Preferences.sublime-settings\nPackages/Default/Preferences (platform).sublime-settings\nPackages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings\n&#x3C;Project Settings >\nPackages/ &#x3C;syntax > / &#x3C;syntax >.sublime-settings\nPackages/User/&#x3C;syntax >.sublime-settings\n&#x3C;Buffer Specific Settings ></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Settings can be set on a default, user, project, or syntax-type basis, and add specific\nsettings for distraction free mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Never set your options using the Default-Settings files!</strong></p>\n<p>The default settings files for Sublime text will be overwritten when you update\nto a new version, and the plugin specific settings will be overwritten when those\nplugins are updated.  Always use the “User-Settings” files instead for “global”\nsettings.  Its not a bad idea to immediately copy the default settings file to\nthe User-Settings file when you’re initially setting up sublime so that you can\nsee all of the options that are set in that file and edit them accordingly.</p>\n<p>Heres my User-Settings file for my Windows-based version of Sublime:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    // Modified Solarized Theme with Mardown Support (https<span class=\"token operator\">:</span>//gist.github.com/<span class=\"token number\">1904917</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n   <span class=\"token property\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/User/Solarized (Light).tmTheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_face\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Consolas\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_size\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Valid options are <span class=\"token string\">\"no_bold\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_italic\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"gray_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    // <span class=\"token string\">\"subpixel_antialias\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"no_round\"</span> (OS X only<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> and <span class=\"token string\">\"directwrite\"</span> (Windows only<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"font_options\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"directwrite\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // If enabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> will highlight any line with a caret\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"highlight_line\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Set to <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> to automatically save files when switching to a different file\n    // or application\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"save_on_focus_lost\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Columns in which to display vertical rulers\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"rulers\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token number\">80</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // The theme controls the look of Sublime Text's UI (buttons<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> tabs<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> scroll bars<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> etc<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"theme\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    // Set to <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> to close windows as soon as the last file is closed<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> unless\n    // there's a folder open within the window.

If you don’t\nlike something about how the program looks, it is probably configurable. Some of the\nmost important visual settings are below:</p>\n<h4>Color Scheme</h4>\n<p>The most obvious configurable visual setting is the color scheme.  Sublime ships\nwith a solid selection of default color schemes, and its easy to find and download\nmore online with <a href=\"http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\">Package Control</a>, which I’ll cover more in the\nplugins article.  I use Sublime’s Monokai Bright theme for JS development, and a\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1904917\">custom Solarized theme</a> for writing in Markdown for this blog and my\nnotes.  You can set color scheme with a command like this in one of your settings files</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token string\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/User/Solarized (Light).tmTheme\"</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>or you can set it in the preferences menu on the top of the screen (this will set it\nin your User-Settings file)</p>\n<h4>Theme</h4>\n<p>You can also configure the overall look and feel of the application.  While the\ndefault is by no means ugly, many people prefer the <a href=\"https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/\">Soda</a> theme that adds\nsome prettier gradients and a choice of a light/dark theme.  You can set that\nlike this after downloading the theme:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token string\">\"theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Quickies</h4>\n<p>Here are a few more quick visual tweaks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“rulers”: set where to show vertical rulers.  Takes an array of integers.  I put one at 80 in order to limit my line lengths in javascript.</li>\n<li>“tab_size”,“translate_tabs_to_spaces”, and “use_tab_stops: Determine space and tabs behaviors.</li>\n<li>“highlight_line”: If true will highlight every line with a cursor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Bindings</h3>\n<p>This is where all of the information from <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2012/12/30/sublime-text-for-javascript-keyboard-shortcuts\">Monday’s post</a> starts to become a whole lot less useful.  All of the keyboard shortcuts that were discussed in that post are completely configurable.  Again you want to use the “User” preferences file in\nPackages/User to set the keybindings.  Keybindings are stored in json form like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+z\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"undo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+shift+z\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"redo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+y\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"redo_or_repeat\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+u\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"soft_undo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+shift+u\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"soft_redo\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You can override existing shortcuts to make common commands more convenient or\ncreate your own by combining <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/commands\">sublime commands</a>.  One cool trick is the ability to define keyboard shortcuts to toggle settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The toggle_setting command can be used to toggle a setting. For example, to make a key binding that toggles the word_wrap setting on the current file, you can use (in Preferences/Key Bindings - User):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"alt+w\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"toggle_setting\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"args\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"setting\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"word_wrap\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The set_setting command can be used to set a setting to a specific value. For example, this key binding makes the current file use the Cobalt color scheme:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"keys\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+k\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"ctrl+c\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"command\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"set_setting\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"args\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"setting\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"color_scheme\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token property\">\"value\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Cobalt.tmTheme\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The settings modified here are buffer specific settings: they override any settings placed in a settings file, but apply to the current file only.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>Plugins also sometimes have their own configuration files.  These generally mimic the format of the editor, and its adviced as usual to use the User Settings for these so as to avoid having your settings blown away with updates</p>\n<h3>Build Systems</h3>\n<p>Sublime also lets you configure custom build systems to build your project.  These can be defined at the same levels of everything else, though in this case it probably makes most sense at the syntax and project level.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<p>Projects are a great way to organize your Sublime Text files.  You can set up a project\nat any time by creating a .sublime-project file (this will happen automatically if you choose save project or edit project in the Project toolbar menu).  The project configuration menu takes a list of folders, a list of settings, and a list of build system settings as a JSON file.  These settings will then override your user level settings for files in the folders that you specify.  This lets you meet project specifications for things like tabs or line length without constantly fiddling with settings.  You also can enable or disable different plugins based on project, and create visual distinction between projects with different color themes.</p>\n<h3>Macros</h3>\n<p>Macros let you save a series of common commands as a json file.  You can then run them\nfrom the “Tools/Macro” menu.  There’s more information in the <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/macros.html\">unofficial docs</a></p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>One final thing that you can configure in Sublime Text is “Snippets”.  Sublime Snippets provide advanced templating ability thats configured with an XML template.  A detailed description of what you can do with snippets is available in the <a href=\"http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html\">unofficial docs</a>.  Suffice it to say that it allows everything from a simple text replacement to full  templating based on a variety of environment variables.</p>\n<p>Sublime contains several Javascript related snippets by default for several basic tasks, and there are more that you can find in other places around the internet.  <a href=\"http://freshbrewedcode.com/jonathancreamer/2012/07/13/a-couple-of-useful-javascript-sublime-text-2-snippets/\">Here’s one example by Jonathan Creamer</a> with a few snippets for plugin development, and a nice little console.log snippet for quick development.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pretty much everything in Sublime can be customized using JSON files</li>\n<li>Use User files or project/syntax specific files, not the Default files</li>\n<li>Learn your options and you can get a lot more out of Sublime Text</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this is helpful.  I’ll be following up with one final post later this week on helpful Sublime plugins for javascript development.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/01/sublime-text-for-javascript-configuration"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,interesting-atom,vim-files","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Discovering Vim","description":"The benefits I've found learning Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/06/02/discovering-vim","date":"2014-06-02T22:00:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I’ve now been using Vim as my primary text editor for the last 9 months.\nWhen I started, I intended to learn it well enough to use in environments that didn’t support Sublime Text. In the end though it ended up becoming my single purpose editor for all occasions. Writing code, blogging, diffs, and reading logs all go through vim.  So why do I use Vim?</p>\n<h4>More Efficient Movement and Editing</h4>\n<p>This is the first thing you hear about from experienced Vimmers, and its an important one.  Once you have your feet under you as a Vim user, you are just able to edit faster.  This can be hard to understand before using Vim (or other keyboard based tools).  Using a mouse doesn’t feel particularly inefficient, and when you start out, Vim’s keyboard mappings can feel arbitrary, unintuitive and slow.  This is one of those times where a little work is needed to get the proper perspective.  Once you’ve had time to learn the basics, even a mediocre typist like me <sup id=\"fnref:1\">\n<a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> can fly when editing by typing smarter not harder.  This isn’t a tutorial on the basics of Vim, but the keys for me were understanding Vim was <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118\">a language in its own right</a>, and the biggest gains in Vim come when you create repeatable options to eliminate inefficiencies. These can be macros, but can also be as simple as using Vim’s easy control for repeating the last action<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>.  Vim is a huge toolbox of small tools that you can use together to create a powerful workstation.</p>\n<h4>Rich Plugin Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Like many things in Vim, the value of its plugin system wasn’t immediately obvious.  Unlike Sublime, which has a community consensus primary package manager and repository, Vim has multiple package managers that pull packages from a variety of locations<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>.  So you need to do some research to figure out what you should be using<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup> and find the right plugins.  But when you do, you’ll find that Vim has fantastic plugins for key tasks like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">fuzzy file search</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">syntax checking</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">in-file search</a>.  It also has a rich depth of plugins for pretty much every language/framework/functionality in common usage, as well as some great plugins that extend Vim’s built in motion/editing language.</p>\n<h4>Long Term Security</h4>\n<p>This one is a judgement call, but from my point of view, Vim is the safest investment of my time out there.  It has a rich open source community, one that has shown that its willing to try <a href=\"http://neovim.org/\">some big ideas</a> to keep from getting stale.  It’s had a great 20 years of usage and doesn’t appear to be in decline.  Sublime Text meanwhile, regrettably seems to be in danger of heading down a similar path to Textmate, with a single developer who has done great work, but <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#x26;t=14591\">doesn’t appear to be interested</a> in being involved in all of the different work that a software business requires.  I don’t think open source is the only way to rely on software<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>, but for general purpose text editors, Vim seems the safest bet to still be around in 10 years.</p>\n<h4>My Brain is Broken Now</h4>\n<p>This is a warning as much as a reason for using Vim, but I’ve quickly found that I’m no longer able to use Sublime or other editors without being frustrated by the fact that they’re not Vim.  Many editors, including Sublime, provide support for a large subset of Vim’s key bindings and modal controls.  But they all fall down at random places.  The power of vim doesn’t lie in one specific functionality, but the composable nature of their different options.  When some of them aren’t there, all the others are weakened, and my trained brain falls out of high efficiency mode into slow plodding “think through every keystroke mode.”  So don’t say I didn’t warn you.  Vim will break your brain.</p>\n<p>Those are the primary reasons I use Vim now.  There are a few things I haven’t loved though.</p>\n<h4>Vim’s UI is uglier than Sublime Text.</h4>\n<p>I’m a front end developer, used to working with, and working to create, beautiful interfaces.  Vim is not beautiful.  It looks like exactly what it is, a text based program with a lineage reaching back to the 70s.  It doesn’t handle margins or padding well, doesn’t have pretty autocomplete menus or visual alerts.  If you use it in the terminal you may be severely restricted in your color options, and this situation is not something that is going to change anytime soon<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup>.  I still love Sublime Text’s UI.  Nice margins, smooth scrolling, the ability to set different font and syntax highlighting options on a filetype basis are all nice gems that Vim just doesn’t offer.  I’ve come to appreciate Vim’s minimalism, but would love to see if Neovim were to offer a way to beautify some of these things.</p>\n<h4>Vim is harder to learn than it should be.</h4>\n<p>I’ve seen some Vimmers object to this (its a power user tool, etc.) but the truth is, when pretty much every Vim tutorial starts by telling you that you should start by changing a bunch of the default settings, it becomes clear that learning Vim is harder than it should be. There’s no reason that basics like line numbers and syntax highlighting shouldn’t be turned on by default.  Configurability is great, but if you start out in a user-hostile state, many people won’t take the time to find the power.  There have been some efforts to change that.  Neovim seems to be actively rethinking this stuff, and projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> aim to help people get started with a richer initial setup.  But the very existence of these reforms points to the fact that Vim shoots itself in the foot with defaults that may have made sense in the eighties, but appear archaic next to modern competitors.</p>\n<p>For now I’m enjoying the Vim experience.  Despite a few warts, I really do think its the best text editor you can use today, and I’m excited to see where it goes in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\nI was never taught to type correctly growing up.

Instead of teaching you how Vim works, they toss a bunch of scary looking code at you, tell you to shove it in a file, and claim that it will make Vim just like Textmate / Sublime / Emacs / Visual Studio. Except way cooler!  People quickly find out that if what they want is to use their old editor, they should just <em>use their old editor</em>, and learn to use it as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>While writing about Vim the last few weeks, I’ve avoided recommending any configuration changes, other than the quick <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">sanity vimrc</a> I recommended in the first article, because I think it’s important to learn what sets Vim apart before trying to configure it.  Not because it’s good enough without configuration (honestly it’s not), but because once you understand the core, you can use configuration to build a great version of Vim instead of trying to hack together a Rube-Goldberg Textmate clone. But now that I’ve covered some of the basics (and if you haven’t yet, feel free to go ahead and start at <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics/\">the beginning</a>), it’s time to look at Vim configuration.</p>\n<h3>Basic Configuration</h3>\n<p>Configuration for Vim starts with a vimrc file. It’s a text file located by default at <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vimrc</code> on *nix systems, and <code class=\"language-text\">$VIM\\_vimrc</code> on Windows.  To begin configuration you need to open that file, creating it if it doesn’t exist. But before we go further, we should stop and figure out what we’re doing.</p>\n<p>I said that configuration starts with the vimrc file, but the truth is that your vimrc is just a normal text file that Vim sources by default.  The heart of Vim configuration is Vimscript, Vim’s custom scripting language.  Vimscript is a full programming language, with variables and control structures.  But for this article we’re going to focus on using it for configuration.</p>\n<p>The basic commands that Vimscript uses for configuration are <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">set</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">let</code> allows you to change a variable value with the syntax <code class=\"language-text\">let &lt;var-name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">set</code> allows you to read or change an option value using <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;</code> for toggle options or <code class=\"language-text\">set &lt;option-name&gt;=&lt;option-value&gt;</code> for numeric or string-based options. <code class=\"language-text\">map</code> and its many variations allow you to create new keymappings by setting the output of one key combination to produce the value of another key combination.  You can use variations on map to specify how a key sequence should behave in different vim modes.</p>\n<h3>Know what you’re configuring</h3>\n<p>Now that you know the basic commands, I could show you an example .vimrc, explain it a bit and then tell you to copy it, change the stuff you don’t like, and go on your way.  The problem with that? It leaves your vimrc file as a “pile of junk”, that I understand and you don’t.   If I did a good job, you might understand the purpose of individual lines, but they probably wouldn’t be the best fit for you, and you probably wouldn’t know exactly how to make it better.  In the end you’ll keep tossing junk onto it until it becomes a confusing mess you want to avoid.  So instead, I’m going to walk through the types of configurations you might want to consider, give a few examples, and let you build from there.  So here are a few concepts to think about as you construct your vimrc file:</p>\n<h4>Adapt to your environment</h4>\n<p>Vi and Vim were originally developed in a low-resource terminal based environment.  Many of their default settings and assumptions reflect that.  Today though Vim is used in a wide variety of ways, from multimonitor Mac Pros with 16+GB of memory running multiple MacVim windows, to low memory remote servers running Vim in the terminal over ssh.  If you know what your environment will look like, you can optimize Vim for your own use.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you’re running in a high resource environment, (and pretty much any modern laptop or desktop these days qualifies as a high resource environment) you may want to enable some features that Vim disables by default, since those removing those features allow it to work well in very low memory situations.  Some  common choices:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable &quot; Turn on syntax highlighting\nset hidden &quot; Leave hidden buffers open\nset history=100 &quot;by default Vim saves your last 8 commands.  We can handle more</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>On the other hand, if you know you’re going to be running remotely on low resource machines, you might choose to disable those options to minimize the load and increase speed. I’ll talk more about plugins in a later post, but they’re another thing that works much better in your local environment than on remote servers, for both performance and logistical reasons.</p>\n<h4>Add some visual niceties</h4>\n<p>If we’re honest, I think most people can agree Vim is pretty hard to look at out of the box.  Very few visual affordances, no syntax highlighting or line numbers, and it’s style is dependent on your terminal color scheme or an ugly default gVim theme. But that’s pretty easy to fix. We can get syntax highlighting and line numbers with this snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">syntax enable\nset number</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Getting a decent color scheme will require you to download it as a plugin, but if you’ve done that or if you like one of the colorschemes that ship with your Vim distribution it’s easy to set up with <code class=\"language-text\">colorscheme &lt;theme-name&gt;</code>.  Beyond that, there’s plenty more you can do to improve the visual feel of Vim.  I’d look into customizing your status bar, relative vs absolute line numbers, and plugins like <a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Vim-Thematic</a>.</p>\n<h4>Set up keybindings</h4>\n<p>Many of Vim’s useful commands are either not given default keybindings, or are given hard to remember obtuse ones.  Don’t want to spend your whole life typing <code class=\"language-text\">source ~/.vimrc</code> into each file everytime you add something to your configuration? I shortcut that to <code class=\"language-text\">\\rr</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">map &lt;leader&gt;rr :source ~/.vimrc&lt;CR&gt;</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You might be wondering what the <leader> notation is there.  The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;leader&gt;</code> key is a Vim convention for a key that comes before user created keystrokes.  It’s meant to minimize conflicts, and allow plugins to provide default mappings while still allowing the user a bit of flexibility.  The leader key can be set in your vimrc with the command <code class=\"language-text\">let mapleader=&lt;yourleaderkey&gt;</code>.  The default is <code class=\"language-text\">\\</code>, and I would recommend leaving it that way to start.  You can change it later if you find it to be inconvenient, and it doesn’t cause any conflicts since its the default key.  Common replacements like <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> overwrite useful functionality that may not be immediately obvious (<code class=\"language-text\">,</code> allows you to move backwards on a characterwise search for instance).</p>\n<h4>Configure plugins and file-type specific settings</h4>\n<p>I’ll touch more on plugins in a future post, but many of them allow extensive configuration, including setting keybindings, changing default behaviors, and enabling/disabling extra functionality. All of that happens here in the vimrc and should mostly use the let/set/map commands that we’ve already seen.</p>\n<p>You can also set file-type specific rules.  Rather than placing these in your main vimrc, these go into a special “file type plugins” directory, <code class=\"language-text\">~/.vim/ftplugin</code>.  Within that directory, you can create files like javascript.vim, python.vim or html.vim, and those files will be loaded after the vimrc when you open files of that type. Using those files, you can create completely separate profiles for each file type.</p>\n<h3>Discover what’s out there</h3>\n<p>I’ve intentionally avoided telling you what your vimrc should look like here.  I’ve tried to show you the big picture of what you can do, and now I’ll leave it to you to figure out what pieces you need to be comfortable and productive.  It will be different for everybody.</p>\n<p>My advice?  Now that you know what you’re looking for, go and take a look at other people’s configurations. Start with something like this <a href=\"https://github.com/benmccormick/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">vimrc boilerplate</a>, and add the things you like.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to find good configurations online if you look.  <a href=\"https://github.com/ben336/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc.symlink\">My vimrc file</a> is on Github.  It’s certainly not the best out there, but its relatively small and easy to follow.  If you know developers you admire who use Vim, ask to see their vimrc files, or see if they have any fancy tricks to share.  For those without those resources,  Github’s <a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">dotfile page</a> is a great place to look.  It contains links to several very detailed “dotfile repos” from various developers. You don’t have to copy everything from these files (in fact you shouldn’t), but you can pull the things that look useful, get rid of things that don’t, and try things out as you slowly build up your own workspace, built to do the jobs that you need it to do.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dotfiles.github.io/\">Github’s dotfile page</a> provides some great pointers to dotfile repositories from experienced developers that can help you come up with cool configuration ideas</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carlhuda/janus\">Janus</a> is a great resource for users who’d prefer to avoid configuration and just start with a useable editor.

It’s based on the Unix philosophy of small composable tools, and doesn’t necessarily match up with the conventions that other editors use for common commands.  So it’s probably not surprising that Vim has its own way of handling copy and paste operations, and in fact doesn’t even use those terms.  Vim’s copy and paste handling is minimalist, composable, and powerful, but most people take some time to adjust to it.  I’m going to walk through the basics here, along with a few advanced features that are worth knowing about.</p>\n<p>The primary Vim commands for copying something are <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> (yank) which acts like most people’s view of copy, and the delete/substitute commands <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> (delete),<code class=\"language-text\">c</code> (change), <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> (single character delete), and <code class=\"language-text\">s</code> (substitute), which unintuitively all act like the more common concept of “cut”.  These can be <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">composed with motion commands to select different regions</a>.  </p>\n<p>Any Vim command that deletes text will also save a copy of that text unless you specifically tell it not too.  The idiomatic Vim method of deleting without copying is <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code>, which probably sounds bizarre.  We’ll come back to that later, and you’ll see that it makes sense in the bigger scheme of Vim’s copy and paste system.</p>\n<p>The basic Vim commands for paste are <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> (put) which pastes after of the current character/line and <code class=\"language-text\">P</code> which pastes before the current character/line.  Vim auto detects whether you’ve yanked text on a line by line basis or a character by character basis, and pastes accordingly. Basically, if you select only full lines it will paste line by line and not break on the cursor position, if you select any partial lines it will paste at the character level, starting or ending at the current cursor location.  Note that <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> also works in visual mode, where it will replace the current selection.</p>\n<p>All of this leads to a very common annoyance for new Vim users.  They’re editing a document and yank some text.  Then they go to a new location, delete a few lines, and hit <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> to replace them with the copied text.  Do you see the problem?  The text that is “put” is not what they originally yanked, but instead it’s the contents of their last delete action. Obviously this can be worked around by changing the order of the actions, but it’s frustrating to users who are used to being able to easily delete without blowing away their paste action.  Even more frustrating is when an experienced Vim user comes by and tells them the answer to their problem is to just type <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;0p</code> instead. Which will in fact put the correct text. So what’s going on with the weird syntax for these basic action?</p>\n<h4>Registers</h4>\n<p>What we’re missing is a clear understanding of how Vim handles copy and paste operations.  So let’s clarify.  Unlike most modern systems, which have a clipboard that holds a single value, Vim can store the values of yank and delete commands in one of many registers.  It has 26 normal registers, which correspond to the letters of the alphabet, and several “special” registers.  One of those special registers is the default register, which is where yank and delete commands store their content by default.  Other registers can be accessed with the <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;&lt;char&gt;</code> prefix that we’ve already seen.  So in the above example, the text from the initial example is moved into the default register, and then replaced there by the deleted text.  But it remains in the 0 register, which always points to the last “yanked” text, ignoring text gained by deleting.</p>\n<p>The 26 alphabetical registers serve as great “medium term” storage.  You can use them to yank something that you want to have around for a while, and then put it in a few different places, even if you’re yanking and deleting other things in the meantime.  These will even persist across sessions as long as you have the <code class=\"language-text\">nocompatible</code> option set in your vimrc file.  However if you overwrite one, there’s no easy way to get it back.  </p>\n<p>One cool feature of registers is the built in ability to append to the end of them.  If you want to add text to an existing register, for instance if you missed part of the text you wanted to yank, you can do so by capitalizing the register.  So if you had deleted a line and put it in the <code class=\"language-text\">a</code> register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;add</code>, but meant to include a second line, you could then delete the next line and append it to the register with <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Add</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;ap</code> would then put the 2 lines back into the document.</p>\n<h4>Special Registers</h4>\n<p>In addition to the alphabetical registers, there are several <em>special registers</em> that are worth knowing about.  I already mentioned the default register, which most Vim users know about, even if they don’t understand exactly how registers work.  Other important registers are the clipboard register, the black hole register, and the numbered registers.</p>\n<p>If you have to learn one special register, learn the clipboard register.  One of the first things people notice about copy and paste in Vim is that it doesn’t interact nicely with other applications’ copy and paste by default.  If you yank a line of text in Vim, it’s not added to the system clipboard.  If you copy some code from Stack Overflow and try to paste it in Vim with <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>, it won’t work <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.  But, since we know about registers, it makes sense that the default register might not be mapped to the clipboard, which we don’t want getting blasted away everytime we delete a character.</p>\n<p>Vim isn’t completely disconnected from the system clipboard though.  The clipboard register <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> is Vim’s proxy to your system clipboard.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+y&lt;motion&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;+p</code> act like traditional copy and paste.  Your version of Vim does have to be compiled with clipboard support in order to use the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> register. You can check to see if you have clipboard support with <code class=\"language-text\">:echo has(&#39;clipboard&#39;).</code><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> On OSX you can use MacVim to get clipboard support, since the default version of Vim shipped with OSX is not compiled with it.  On other operating systems you’ll have to investigate the easiest way to install with clipboard support if your version doesn’t have it.  It should be enabled for most modern mainstream distributions.</p>\n<p>Another register to quickly note is the black hole register <code class=\"language-text\">_</code>.  The black hole register, as you would expect, doesn’t retain what’s passed to it.  So <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_y</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_p</code> are no-ops, and <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;_d</code> is “true delete”, as opposed to the delete commands default “cut” like behavior.  Of course since most people don’t use all 26 alphabetical registers, you can also achieve effective true delete by deleting to any unused register.</p>\n<p>Finally, the number keys also have special register functionality.  You can’t yank text directly to a numbered register.  Instead the <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> register contains the last yanked text, and the <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> through <code class=\"language-text\">9</code> registers contain the last 9 deleted chunks of text.  This feature is a cool idea, but unfortunately the implementation is inconsistent and a bit weird.  For one thing the distinction between yanked and deleted text seems arbitrary, and since they act the same in other ways, puts an added cognitive load on the user to remember which one they used.  Secondly, for whatever reason, deletions that span less than a line get special behavior.  If you delete these to an alphabetical register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code> just like any other delete.  But if you delete them to the default register, they’re saved to <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;-</code> and not put in <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;1</code>.  The logic is complicated enough that the numbered registers become tough to use in day to day tasks, and I’ll have to agree with Drew Neil in labeling them one of Vim’s <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/\">“bad parts.”</a></p>\n<h4>Macros</h4>\n<p>One last important thing to know about registers is that along with being used for copy and paste, they serve as a place to save macros, Vim’s reusable command language.  You can save a macro by typing <code class=\"language-text\">q&lt;register key&gt;&lt;commands&gt;q</code>, and the macro will be saved to the register.  Like yank and delete, capitalizing the register name will let you append to the register instead of replacing it. So there’s a few things you should know about that.  One, if you use macros, don’t save macros to the same registers that you use for copy and paste.  If you use the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> register a lot for the convenience of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;yy&lt;motion&gt;</code>, don’t use <code class=\"language-text\">qy</code> to save your macro unless you’re ok with it being blown away by your next yank.  Two, the sharing of registers allows you to copy text to use as a macro.  So if you for instance wanted to have a file with a list of common operations, it would be easy to go to that file, copy a line, and then execute it as a macro.  This isn’t the first thing most people will want to do, but it illustrates the power and flexibility that come when you start combining Vim’s tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For a more in depth look at Vim’s special registers, including a bunch I didn’t cover here, you can check out this great <a href=\"http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/advanced-vim-registers/\">roundup</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/categories/copy-and-paste/\">Vimcasts</a> has a whole series of posts on copy and paste in Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Of course some people would probably see that as a feature, not a bug\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:2\">\n        <p>\n        Thanks to schweinschmeisser on Reddit for reminding me to add a way to check for support.\n    \t<a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/07/27/learning-vim-in-2014-copy-and-paste-the-vim-way"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: Search","description":"How to search for anything in Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search","date":"2014-08-04T01:16:20+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Have you ever tried to summarize something that was just too big to explain?  I’ve covered a lot of ground in my posts on Vim this past month, but it’s only scratched the surface of what Vim has to offer.  The goal was to create a foundation that people could start with, and then let them build on their own. There’s not a conclusive way to say what somebody “needs to know” when learning Vim.  Most people don’t (and shouldn’t) use every feature of the editor, they use the ones that make sense for them.  So I’ve tried to cover the things that I know people have found useful, and the philosophy behind how Vim works, and then let you figure out what you’d like to use on your own.  This post wraps up the series, but I wanted to highlight one last feature of Vim, its fantastic search capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Vim has an extremely powerful built in search tool.  To use it, you can type <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> at anytime in normal mode to start entering search terms.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code> followed by enter searches for the next occurrence of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document.  You can then skip over matches with <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> or go backwards with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code>.  If you wanted to start by searching backwards, you could have started with <code class=\"language-text\">?foo</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">/foo</code>, in which case <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> would reverse behavior, with <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> moving forward in the document and <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> moving back.  It’s easiest to think of <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> as “next match” and <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> as “previous match”, with the direction determined by the search operator, <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">?</code>.</p>\n<p>The search tool can be used for more than simple literal expressions, it also takes regular expressions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">/fo.\\|bar</code> will match <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">fox</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  You also can search for lines containing both foo and bar with the expression <code class=\"language-text\">/.*foo\\&amp;.*bar</code>.  If you want to dig deeper into Vim’s regex language, I’d recommend typing in <code class=\"language-text\">:h pattern</code> to check out the excellent documentation.</p>\n<h3>Substitute</h3>\n<p>Search is great, but in many cases what we want to use it for is replacing or acting on each instance.  Vim’s search and replace command looks something like <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/foo/bar/g</code>, which will replace all occurences of <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> in the document with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code>.  Let’s break that down a bit.  <code class=\"language-text\">:s</code> (substitute) is Vim’s search and replace command.  By default it only works on the current line, so in order to get it to act on the whole document I prepended the <code class=\"language-text\">%</code> character, which sets the range to include everything.  If you want a smaller range, you can select the text you want to act on in visual mode. Typing <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> will then preload the range into the command area.  Substitute takes an expression in the form <code class=\"language-text\">/&lt;search expression&gt;/&lt;replace string&gt;/&lt;modifiers&gt;</code>  where search expression defines the search, replace string is the text to substitute in, and modifiers are single letter arguments that change the behavior.  By default only the first instance of an expression per line is substituted, so I added the <code class=\"language-text\">g</code> modifier to tell Vim to substitute all instances of the search expression on a line.  Other useful modifiers are <code class=\"language-text\">i</code>, which makes the search case insensitive, and <code class=\"language-text\">c</code> which has Vim prompt for confirmation before substituting each instance. Confirmation is helpful if you want to change most but not all occurences of a phrase. One useful behavior of substitute to be aware of: If you leave the search expression blank, it reuses your last search.  So if you’ve been playing around with a regex to get the right expression, once you get it right you can type <code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;replacement&gt;/g</code>, and it will replace all instances, without forcing you to retype your complicated regex.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that search plays nicely with Vim’s <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">composable actions</a>, and you can use it as a motion command with <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">c</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> or other actions.  For instance <code class=\"language-text\">d/foo</code> will delete all text up to the next occurence of foo in the document. <code class=\"language-text\">y?foo</code> will yank all text backwards to the previous occurence of foo in the document.</p>\n<h3>Inline Searching</h3>\n<p>Along with the primary search and substitute commands, Vim has other specialty searching tools.  One of these is its <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> commands. <code class=\"language-text\">f&lt;char&gt;</code> moves to a single character on the current line.  While less powerful than <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, this can be super useful because of its quick composability and guarantee of not moving out of the current scope.  It’s really easy to type <code class=\"language-text\">cf)</code> to delete through the end of the parentheses.  <code class=\"language-text\">t</code> works similarly, but is non-inclusive, so you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ct)</code> to delete everything up to and not including the parentheses.  I remember it as “change find character” and “change to character” respectively.  Like <code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, these commands support backwards and repeated search.  <code class=\"language-text\">F</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">T</code> search backwards on the current line, and <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> are the default commands for “next match” and “previous match” respectively.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file searching with vimgrep and grep</h3>\n<p>Searching within a file is nice, but what if you want to search in multiple files?  Vim provides 2 commands for that.  The first, <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep</code>, uses Vim’s internal regex engines to search across multiple files. You could for instance type <code class=\"language-text\">:vimgrep /function/i ./*.js</code> to search all Javascript files in the current directory for the “function” keyword.  You’d then be able to loop through them using the <code class=\"language-text\">:ln</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:lp</code> commands.</p>\n<p>The second command, <code class=\"language-text\">:grep</code>, integrates with an external search application (grep by default), to do the searching.  The advantage of the first is that it’s portable and will be available anywhere and everywhere that Vim is.  But generally external tools are going to be faster than Vim’s internal search engine.  Grep for instance is faster than vimgrep.  I personally use the external tool <a href=\"http://beyondgrep.com/\">ack</a> which is faster than grep.  Regardless though, Vim has support for whatever approach you choose to take.</p>\n<h3>Cross-file replace with the arglist</h3>\n<p>Up till now we’ve mostly been dealing with tasks that Vim has good answers for.  If you want to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim though, you end up in some of the more esoteric parts of Vim-land.  In order to do a search and replace across multiple files in Vim, you need to first define a set of files to edit, and then run the replace command.  Unfortunately there is no way in Vim to cleanly do this all in a single command.  Instead you must pull your list of files from one of 3 places, the arglist, the buffer list, or the window list.  The arglist is by default the files that you specified to open when you initially opened Vim, the buffer list is your list of currently opened buffers, and the window list is the list of files in currently open windows.  Since you probably don’t want to have to open or view all the files that you want to run a search/replace on, and you may want to have files open or visible without running a replace on them, the arglist is the list of choice for replacements.  Vim allows you to edit the contents of the arglist at any time using the <code class=\"language-text\">:argadd</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">argdelete</code> commands.  So to replace <code class=\"language-text\">foo</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">bar</code> for all javascript files in the current directory you might type something like.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">:argd * &quot;Clear arglist\n:arga ./*.js  &quot;Add javascript files\n:argdo %s/foo/bar/g &quot;Substitute on each file</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">argdo</code> is the command to execute a command across all files in the arglist.  <code class=\"language-text\">bufdo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">tabdo</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">windo</code> work the same way for every “open buffer”, “active window in each tab”, and “window in the current tab” respectively. Personally I find this all to be a pain.  A single command that let you specify an action and a range to run it on like <code class=\"language-text\">:do &#39;%s/foo/bar/g&#39; ./*.js</code> would make plenty of sense.  But since that doesn’t exist, it’s worth at least knowing that the arglist is there, and being able to resort to it if necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Power Of Search</h3>\n<p>Most people start out using Vim knowing that they can move around with <em>hjkl</em> and switch between files with <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code> as they learn more they grow their toolbox. Search is a great tool for moving quickly around text in Vim, and for powerfully making big edits.  Searching allows you to allow your brain to focus on the big picture, rather than remembering exactly where each piece of code or content is located. Like everything else in Vim, it’s a tool that you can combine with other tools to create powerful workflows.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/\">Vimcasts</a> has a nice piece on the <code class=\"language-text\">gn</code> command, an alternative to <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> that lets you select the next search match in visual mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace\">Vim’s wiki</a> also has a nice writeup of the <code class=\"language-text\">:substitute</code> command, with lots of examples and details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2014/08/04/learning-vim-in-2014-search"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"learning-vim,vim-files,vim-language","topics":["Vim","Text Editors"],"category":"tools","key":null,"title":"Learning Vim in 2014: The Basics","description":"The basics of learning Vim","layout":"post","path":"/2014/06/30/learning-vim-in-2014-the-basics","date":"2014-06-30T11:28:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Do you want to be efficient writing code?  Using Vim can be a powerful help.  Using it has let me move more effectively through the process of writing and editing code.  But getting to where I am now was frustrating. Vim resources are scattered across the web, and contain a lot of different advice.  It’s tough to figure out how to make Vim work for you.  In my next few posts, I’m going to talk about the process of learning a 23 year old programming power tool, and what you need to know in 2014 to be productive with Vim.  Today I’ll start with the basics, stuff that goes back all the way to the 1970s, and we’ll grow from there.</p>\n<h3>Why has Vim Survived?</h3>\n<p>Vim has been around for a while.  Originally released in 1991 as an improvement on vi (which had been around since 1976), it has outlasted a generation of programmers. The software world has changed a lot since 1991.  So why do people still use it?  </p>\n<p>Vim provides a system for editing text that is quite simply more powerful than its modern graphical based alternatives.  It asks a lot of its users. To use Vim effectively you have to internalize the syntax for many commands that have better affordances on other editors.  But you’re rewarded with a friction-free editing environment.  Vi’s commands are fast, composable, and powerful. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h3>Step 0: Setup</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is install a copy of Vim. If you’re on a Linux or Mac system, there is likely already a system copy, but it is probably not up to date.  So use your system’s package manager to get the latest version (7.4 at the time of this writing).  For Mac users I recommend using <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> to download <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a>. Windows users can download the latest executable on <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/download.php\">Vim.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The second thing you’ll need is a vimrc (the file vim uses for configuration).  These files can become quite extensive, setting up many different options, configurations, and plugins.  But we’re going to start simple.  Download <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/benmccormick/4e4bc44d8135cfc43fc3\">this minimal vimrc file</a> and install it in the appropriate directory for your OS as instructed.  If you already have a .vimrc file but don’t understand it, I’d recommend saving it elsewhere and using a minimal one for now. You can then build it out as you learn more.  </p>\n<h3>Step 1: Learn the Syntax</h3>\n<p>Just like a programming language, the first thing to learn for Vim is the basic syntax.  Vim has a built in tool to help you get comfortable called vimtutor.  It’s a text file set up to help you learn to navigate Vim. Once vim is installed you can run it by calling vimtutor on unix-style systems.  On Windows you can follow the instructions <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/270938/how-to-run-vimtutor-on-windows\">here</a>. It will take you through a series of 7 lessons that will familiarize you with the basic commands.</p>\n<p>Vim has rather non-standard commands, and it may be frustrating at first adapting to its different terminology and conventions.  The payoff comes slowly, but it does come.</p>\n<h4>Modes</h4>\n<p>The most important thing to understand is that Vim is a modal editor.  At any given time you’re in one of 6 modes.  You will have different abilities and keystrokes available to you in each of these modes.  For right now the key modes to understand are Normal Mode, Insert Mode, and Command line Mode.</p>\n<p>Normal Mode is the default mode.  It’s roughly equivalent to the state that other editors are in when you’re holding down the ctrl or cmd keys.  Instead of entering text onto the screen, different keys trigger different commands.  Initially this is a bit weird.  Those of us coming from other editors or IDEs are used to being able to type text by default.  The thought is that adding text is the primary task in a text editor.  But Vim treats adding text as sitting on equal footing with editing, deleting and manipulating existing text, and starts us in a mode where we can quickly make any change. To steal an analogy from Drew Neil, normal mode is the opportunity to take our paintbrush off the canvas while we decide our next stroke.  </p>\n<p>Insert mode is the equivalent of most editor’s normal state.  When you type a key in normal mode, it appears on the screen. You can enter insert mode by pressing <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> in visual mode, and exit it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Command line mode lets you enter ex-commands, a command line language that complements normal modes shortcuts.  You enter it by hitting <code class=\"language-text\">:</code> in normal mode.  Important commands are <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code> to write (save) a file, and <code class=\"language-text\">:q!</code> to quit.</p>\n<p>The above commands, and an understanding of the modes are enough for you to survive in Vim, and treat it as a sort of awkward Notepad clone.  You can edit files, save them, and quit.  Going through vimtutor will introduce you to many more commands, and a few more modes.  But you can learn those at your own pace.  Right now you want to see what taking time to learn this awkward unfamiliar syntax can buy you.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Learn the Language</h3>\n<p>Vim’s key commands are different than you’ll find in other editors like Sublime Text.  They’re not a series of standalone actions that you can do one after another to get what you want.  Instead they form a language.  </p>\n<p>Vim statements are made up of actions and motions.  The actions are what you’re trying to do, the motions are where you want to do them.</p>\n<p>For example let’s take the <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> action. <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> deletes. You can delete a single character by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dl</code>.  You can delete 2 characters by typing <code class=\"language-text\">d2l</code>. You can delete a whole line by typing <code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, or delete inside a word by typing <code class=\"language-text\">diw</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you learn the d action, you can use it with every motion you know. Similarly, when you learn a new motion, you can then use it with every action you know.</p>\n<p>So if somebody shows me the <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> action and tells me that it yanks (copies) text, I’ll know I can yank a character with <code class=\"language-text\">yl</code> a line with <code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> and inside the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">yiw</code>.  Each new Vim command is a tool in your toolbox, and since the tools build off of each other they become exponentially more valuable.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Learn the Mindset</h3>\n<p>Vim can make you hyper-efficient.  But to get there you need to know more than just the command combinations available.  You have to shift your mindset.  Vim commands aren’t just easy to learn, they’re designed to be repeatable.  Bram Moolenar, Vim’s creator has listed out <a href=\"http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html\">7 habits of effective text editing</a>.  The second habit, don’t type it twice, is a pretty good summary of the “Vim Way” of doing things.</p>\n<p>Vim provides a bunch of ways to avoid repetition.  I’ll get into them in another post. For now though, let’s take a look at <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>, the dot command.  The dot command repeats the last action you’ve taken. For instance, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to change a word, hit <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;esc&gt;</code> to return to normal mode, then move to another word and type <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace that word as well.  You are able to avoid retyping the replacement word as well as the <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> command. You can run the whole replace with one keystroke, regardless of what words you’re replacing.  Like other Vim commands, the dot command is small on its own, but gains power as you add more tools to your toolbox.</p>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<p>If you enjoyed this article you’ll probably also enjoy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356980&linkCode=as2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS\">Practical Vim</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356980\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\">: This amazing book by Drew Neil, the creator of <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/\">Vimcasts</a> was the single best resource I found as I learned Vim.

If you’re reading this blog, I bet you like it.  What if I told you your text editor could help you cut the amount of time you spend typing in half, with just a little reading and a bit of practice?  For you Vim users, it’s very possible that you’re spending way more time typing than needed.</p>\n<p>The software developers reading this have probably heard of the <em>Don’t Repeat Yourself</em> principle.  Developers want to avoid duplicating work, and try to write each distinct meaningful chunk of code only once.  DRY is extremely powerful when it comes to code, but it’s also a very useful principle in text editing.  Much of the editing work we do is extremely repetitive. Vim can help you remove those inefficiencies.</p>\n<p>If Vim’s composable commands are the <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language of Vim</a>, then repeating commands are it’s art.  For pretty much any thing you do in Vim, there are ways to automate and repeat it.  These “repeating commands” are powerful tools, but it’s not always easy to know what to do with them.  There aren’t simple rules you can learn for when to use repeating commands.  Instead it takes practice, awareness, and experience.  </p>\n<p>All of Vim’s commands are designed to be repeatable and undoable.  So if you find yourself typing something a lot, there is likely to be a good solution for making it easier and faster.  I’m going to lay out the tools for doing that, along with a few hints for knowing when to use them.</p>\n<h4>Repetition Basics: The dot command</h4>\n<p>The most important Vim tool for repetition is the dot command.  Pressing <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> at any time will repeat the last native command you used in Vim.  How is this useful?  Let’s say we’re faced with the following code</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> widget <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Widget</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> widgets <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">WidgetCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nwidgets<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>widget<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>widget<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'widget passed test'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If we want to rename the <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code> variable to be more informative, how could we go about it? We’ll ignore “language-wise” refactoring solutions, like <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">ternjs</a>, and look at the basic Vim options.  </p>\n<p>A simple find and replace causes problems.  We can’t distinguish between the widget we want and other occurences.  <code class=\"language-text\">:%s/widget/testWidget/g</code> results in plenty of unwanted changes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidget <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Widget</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> testWidgets <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">WidgetCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ntestWidgets<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>testWidget<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">test</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">sendMessage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'testWidget passed test'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>It might be possible to find a complex regex that only hit the variables we want, but thats suddenly a lot of thought for what should be a simple change.  We could go one by one and knock out each word one by one.  But that would be a lot of repeated typing of <code class=\"language-text\">testWidget</code>.  So what can we do?</p>\n<p>The dot command is a nice solution.  If we start on the first occurence of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">ciw</code> to replace the current word with new text.  When we’ve added our new text and exit insert mode, we’ll have a <em>command</em>, which we can then repeat with <code class=\"language-text\">.</code>. After that we can move to the next occurence we want to change and hit <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to replace it without retyping the variable name.  If we accidentally use it in the wrong place, it’s easy to undo with <code class=\"language-text\">u</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course it would still be a pain to navigate between each widget with hjkl.  Fortunately, Vim has more commands that allow us to avoid unecessary work.  If we start on one instance of <code class=\"language-text\">widget</code>, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> to search for all occurences of that word.  We can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> to move from occurence to occurence. If we overshoot and go too far, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">N</code> to go backwards.  So if we start with <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> (shift+8 in the gif below) and then use ciw to replace the word, we can then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> to clean up the other widgets in only 5 keystrokes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/vimdotcommand-fcd9036267e137c552c8afdc822b223f.gif\" alt=\"vim gif\"></p>\n<h4>The Vim Way</h4>\n<p>If you’re used to another editor, I’m guessing you’re justifiably a bit skeptical at this point.  After all, this example is something people do all the time, and many editors have tools to make it easy (multiple selections in Sublime Text and refactoring tools in language specific IDEs like Eclipse for instance).  They may take even fewer keystrokes than Vim. And they don’t require you to learn 6 separate commands to use well.  So what’s so special here?</p>\n<p>Let’s have a quick refresher on the philosophy of Vim.  Like the Unix ecosystem it came from, Vim provides <strong>small</strong>, <strong>composable</strong> tools that you can combine to create powerful actions.  The power isn’t in a specific use case.  Instead it comes from the range of possibilities that open up when we start mixing and matching the code.  As with verbs, movements, and text objects, repeating commands and their corresponding reverse commands are tools we can add to our toolbox.  Using the commands above and some of the other composable commands from my <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">language post</a>, we can do some cool things.</p>\n<p>We can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search through json files and selectively remove lines that contain an attribute we don’t want to use (start on the attribute, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">dd</code>, then use <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly to select lines to delete)</li>\n<li>Replace a long, hard to type function name throughout the document with another version without having to type out the function name (start on the function name, <code class=\"language-text\">*</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:%s//&lt;newname&gt;/g</code>)</li>\n<li>Fix poorly indented lines using the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command (<code class=\"language-text\">&gt;&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;&lt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> repeatedly, <code class=\"language-text\">u</code> to undo if you go too far. This can easily be used on groups of lines using visual mode too)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do all of these have in common?  They all use a command once, and a movement at most once, then allow for as much repetition as you like.  In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356980/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=1934356980&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=benmccormicko-20&#x26;linkId=FE3JFKHYVRYCUOVS\">Practical Vim</a>, Drew Neil encourages actively thinking about making your actions repeatable.  In many scenarios, once you’ve made a change and movement once, you can then get by with a single keystroke for each future action and movement, with another keystroke available to cancel an action if you go too far.  Here’s a partial list of repeating commands, with the corresponding cancel command to undo them.</p>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Repeating Command</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Canceling Command</th></tr>\n<tr><td>.</td><td>Repeat the last normal mode command</td><td>u</td></tr>\n<tr><td>n</td><td>Repeat the last Search</td><td>N</td></tr>\n<tr><td>;</td><td>Repeat the last character-wise search</td><td>,</td></tr>\n<tr><td>/<replacement>/</td><td>Repeat the last search</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@:</td><td>Repeat the last ex-mode command</td><td>N/A</td></tr>\n<tr><td>@@</td><td>Repeat the last Macro used</td><td>u</td></tr>\n</table>\n<p>None of these commands are all that useful on their own, but they’re each valuable things to learn as you build up your Vim toolbox. Focus on one or two to start, and learn to make edits so that you can easily repeat them. The art of Vim is learning to look for those opportunities, and crafting your commands so that they’re short, powerful, and repeatable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of you are probably confused that I wrote a whole post on repeating commands in Vim with only one side-reference to Macros.

One of the messiest parts of my transition to using Vim full time was its way of dealing with files.  Coming to Vim after primarily using Eclipse and Sublime Text, it frustrated me that Vim doesn’t bundle a persistent file system viewer, and the built-in ways of opening and switching files always felt extremely painful.  </p>\n<p>At this point I appreciate the depth of Vim’s file management features. I’ve put together a system that works for me even better than more visual editors once did. Because it’s purely keyboard based, it allows me to move through my code much faster.  That took some time though, and involves several plugins. But the first step was me understanding Vim’s built in options for dealing with files. This post will be looking at the most important structures Vim provides you for file management, with a quick peek at some of the more advanced features you can get through plugins.</p>\n<h3>The Basics: Opening a new file</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles to learning Vim is its lack of visual affordances.  Unlike modern GUI based editors, there is no obvious way to do anything when you open a new instance of Vim in the terminal.  Everything is done through keyboard commands, and while that ends up being more efficient for experienced users, new Vim users will find themselves looking up even basic commands routinely.  So lets start with the basics.</p>\n<p>The command to open a new file in Vim is <code class=\"language-text\">:e &lt;filename&gt;</code>.  <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> opens up a new buffer with the contents of the file inside. If the file doesn’t exist yet it opens up an empty buffer and will write to the file location you specify once you make changes and save. Buffers are Vim’s term for a “block of text stored in memory”. That text can be associated with an existing file or not, but there will be one buffer for each file you have open.</p>\n<p>After you open a file and make changes, you can save the contents of the buffer back to the file with the write command <code class=\"language-text\">:w</code>.  If the buffer is not yet associated with a file or you want to save to a different location, you can save to a specific file with <code class=\"language-text\">:w &lt;filename&gt;</code>. You may need to add a <code class=\"language-text\">!</code> and use <code class=\"language-text\">:w! &lt;filename&gt;</code> if you’re overwriting an existing file.</p>\n<p>This is the survival level knowledge for dealing with Vim files.  Plenty of developers get by with just these commands, and its technically all you need.  But Vim offers a lot more for those who dig a bit deeper.</p>\n<h3>Buffer Management</h3>\n<p>Moving beyond the basics, let’s talk some more about buffers.  Vim handles open files a bit differently than other editors.  Rather than leaving all open files visible as tabs, or only allowing you to have one file open at a time, Vim allows you to have multiple buffers open.  Some of these may be visible while others are not.  You can view a list of all open buffers at any time with <code class=\"language-text\">:ls</code>.  This shows each open buffer, along with their buffer number.  You can then switch to a specific buffer with the <code class=\"language-text\">:b &lt;buffer-number&gt;</code> command, or move in order along the list with the <code class=\"language-text\">:bnext</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bprevious</code> commands. (these can be shortened to <code class=\"language-text\">:bn</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bp</code> respectively).  </p>\n<p>While these commands are the fundamental Vim solutions for managing buffers, I’ve found that they don’t map well to my own way of thinking about files.  I don’t want to care about the order of buffers, I just want to go to the file I’m thinking about, or maybe to the file I was just in before the current one.  So while its important to understand Vim’s underlying buffer model, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend its builtin commands as your main file management strategy.  There are more powerful options available.</p>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-8476c.jpeg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.15424164524421%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"splits example\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-6fbc3.jpeg\" srcset=\"/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-da4c7.jpeg 143w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-1d39e.jpeg 285w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-6fbc3.jpeg 570w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-9d77e.jpeg 855w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-e356a.jpeg 1140w,\n/static/skitch-e04bb8adecac1fcf97823f3f86913f0e-8476c.jpeg 1167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h3>Splits</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of managing files in Vim is its splits.  With Vim, you can split your current window into 2 windows at any time, and then resize and arrange them into any configuration you like.  Its not unusual for me to have 6 files open at a given time, each with its own small split of the window.</p>\n<p>You can open a new split with <code class=\"language-text\">:sp &lt;filename&gt;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">:vs &lt;filename&gt;</code>, for horizontal and vertical splits respectively.  There are keyword commands you can use to then resize the windows the way you want them, but to be honest this is the one Vim task I prefer to do with my mouse.  A mouse gives me more precision without having to guess the number of columns I want or fiddle back and forth between 2 widths.  </p>\n<p>After you create some splits, you can switch back and forth between them with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-w [h|j|k|l]</code>.  This is a bit clunky though, and it’s important for common operations to be efficient and easy. If you use splits heavily, I would personally recommend aliasing these commands to <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-h</code> <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-j</code> etc in your .vimrc using this snippet.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vimscript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-vimscript\"><code class=\"language-vimscript\">nnoremap &lt;C-J&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-J&gt; &quot;Ctrl-j to move down a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-K&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-K&gt; &quot;Ctrl-k to move up a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-L&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-L&gt; &quot;Ctrl-l to move\tright a split\nnnoremap &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-H&gt; &quot;Ctrl-h to move left a split</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h3>The jumplist</h3>\n<p>Splits solve the problem of viewing multiple related files at a time, but we still haven’t seen a satisfactory solution for moving quickly between open and hidden files.  The jumplist is one tool you can use for that.  </p>\n<p>The jumplist is one of those Vim features that can appear weird or even useless at first.  Vim keeps track of every motion command and file switch you make as you’re editing files.  Every time you “jump” from one place to another in a split, Vim adds an entry to the jumplist. While this may initially seem like a small thing, it becomes powerful when you’re switching files a lot, or moving around in a large file.  Instead of having to remember your place, or worry about what file you were in, you can instead retrace your footsteps quickly using some quick key commands.  <code class=\"language-text\">Ctrl-o</code> allows you to jump back to your last jump location.  Repeating it multiple times allows you to quickly jump back to the last file or code chunk you were working on, without having to keep the details of where that code is in your head. You can then move back up the chain with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl-i</code>. This turns out to be immensely powerful when you’re moving around in code quickly, debugging a problem in multiple files or flipping back and forth between 2 files. Instead of typing file names or remembering buffer numbers, you can just move up and down the existing path.  It’s not the answer to everything, but like other Vim concepts, it’s a small focused tool that adds to the overall power of the editor without trying to do everything.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>So let’s be real, if you’re coming to Vim from something like Sublime Text or Atom, there’s a good chance all of this looks a bit arcane, scary, and inefficient.  “Why would I want to type the full path to open a file when Sublime has fuzzy finding?”  “How can I get a view of a project’s structure without a sidebar to show the directory tree?”  Legitimate questions.  The good news is that Vim has solutions.  They’re just not baked into the Vim core.  I’ll touch more on Vim configuration and plugins in later posts, but for now here’s a pointer to 3 helpful plugins that you can use to get Sublime-like file management.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is a fuzzy finding file search similar to Sublime’s “Go to Anything” bar.  It’s lightning fast and pretty configurable.  I use it as my main way of opening new files.  With it I only need to know part of the file name and don’t need to memorize my project’s directory structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is a “file navigation drawer” plugin that replicates the side file navigation that many editors have.  I actually rarely use it, as fuzzy search always seems faster to me.  But it can be useful coming into a project, when you’re trying to learn the project structure and see what’s available.  NERDTree is immensely configurable, and also replaces Vim’s built in directory tools when installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> is a code search plugin for Vim that allows you to search across your project for text expressions.  It acts as a light wrapper around Ack or Ag, <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">2 great code search tools</a>, and allows you to quickly jump to any occurrence of a search term in your project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Between it’s core and its plugin ecosystem, Vim offers enough tools to allow you to craft your workflow anyway you want.  File management is a key part of a good software development system, and it’s worth experimenting to get it right.</p>\n<p>Start with the basics for long enough to understand them, and then start adding tools on top until you find a comfortable workflow. It will all be worth it when you’re able to seamlessly move to the code you want to work on without the mental overhead of figuring out how to get there.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/seamlessly-navigate-vim-and-tmux-splits\">Seamlessly Navigate Vim &#x26; Tmux Splits</a> - This is a must read for anyone who wants to use vim with <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">tmux</a>.

Over the last 10 years, the JavaScript ecosystem has built up a rich set of tools to make your life easier.  Most of the buzz around tooling comes from browser devtools and the various build systems available for JavaScript projects, but you can also take advantage of improved tools within your code editor.  While there are some great IDEs for JavaScript development out there like WebStorm and Visual Studio, most JavaScript developers seem to prefer lighter-weight text editors.  So this post is going to be a quick look at the tools I use for more seamless JavaScript development in a text editor.</p>\n<h3>Basics</h3>\n<p>Before we get to anything JavaScript specific, there are a few important things to set up.  First, I’m assuming that you’re using a modern, extensible text editor. Those include, but are not limited to: <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a>, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\">Emacs</a>. There is great support for all of the below tips in each of these editors<sup id=\"fnref:0\"><a href=\"#fn:0\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In addition you should have</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reasonable default configurations<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>A fast system for navigating between files<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">3</a></sup></li>\n<li>Great code searching<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">4</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re still working through those things, make sure to take the time to learn a bit more about your editor along with any JavaScript specific tools you use.  There’s a ton of efficiency you can gain from having those 3 things in place.</p>\n<p>Finally the first two tips below require <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">node.JS</a> and npm to be installed, as they rely on node libraries to function.  If you’ve never installed those before, the process is pretty painless.</p>\n<p>Once you have all of that in place, we can move on to other things.</p>\n<h3>Syntax Linting</h3>\n<p>JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly-typed language.  It is also written by human beings.  As a result, it can be easy to start running bad code without realizing that it has problems.  Some types of problems you’ll find out about quickly.  Bad syntax will halt program execution for instance.  But others will linger, subtly effecting logic or just making the code hard to understand for future developers (including yourself).   </p>\n<p>JavaScript linters (also called syntax checkers) can provide some of the safety of a compiler, and also help enforce a consistent set of styles to help maintain readability.  They are not magic.  JavaScript is still a weakly typed language with some weird syntactical sinkholes. It’s relatively easy to make logic mistakes if you’re undisciplined.  But linters are a great safety tool, especially for developers newer to JavaScript and its conventions.  Run as part of a build process, they can prevent you shipping bad code and help standardize conventions across a team</p>\n<p>While it’s a great idea to make linters part of your build process, you get even more power from integrating them with your editor.  Almost all modern text editors include some sort of plugin for displaying syntax errors and warnings in the gutter to the left of the text.  You can check out the integration pages for <a href=\"http://eslint.org/docs/integrations/\">ESLint</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/install/\">jsHint</a> to get a feel for the plugins available for your editor.  </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-141ef.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 82.47422680412372%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAQCAIAAACZeshMAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAADGUlEQVQoz1VSS28cRRCeH8A5AYkD2rWd3Z2Znu6Zfs30Y167s+Nd765NYmQRoRwQiEckDuFCSALm4kTihLMbB6TERoodRViK4ygcIAmC3wC/h5rAAVo1Nf36ur76qpxn975//OjOoycPnz19fHJ84/79ew8eHB4dHR4cHOzv78Py6Pj06OTXh09++enpy8OT53+8ePHny9O/fv/5t+MfnbSuR6NRURSrZX/VZqNhtTYe1/VwNp1kWaYTma5tDd79bLB1udq6XF68cvHtje1NfXUjOb11xfmAMx5Lz3WLNE0EpzRilMaxlFIwRgUXyHO7K+3euSUwmKx0Ou0eOvPmW9/t/eBcEiLRKkBoqHWuNWWUAYjSIAjCkNCIBzjyEPJ8HwwG8n0SoOVWazG/7cSptUZ3u13wF2aT8XC4sT6FvTxPwQMBo2IREZ3ESmvCdSQUM9Yl+O7entNcsbrnuhAzE3BIgbBK4iy14DHGhGAcIHAwRUFjOIyWV1YWi4VjjNYqCQnhjHZ7PXjF7TX/brfzz8prduBzG9KeBwY5tlqt+XzhNKQBHHEfhz7CCIdgTWoIezCLIp8Qyjm8/i/e90GOdrs9n88dm1pjdUjloBgWw1E1nmXVqCj79dqkHs/q6bquqsnmhenGTArhed7/wGVukyTxPVdJUVuTS1EZOchtXQ/yLBXKpllh8oIpBWn/F9zkDIGTJIa1UopHEQ1DQSPJmZCSvqoZF5IxiSMGdYNrDRhjAO/u7oJgjWLwYGlMbawVtK9lXVfa6MoIUNwjDEecCB5yHiCg6CKElpaWdnZ2XgmmFQqCqiwAn1qoqITi5dCc1hR5KmKFWQzlJVISxsNEMa27nXM3b96CyBYIQw8ZwfvQldCh0GKca22EjI01TMQQijSlDkjg48CPSNBZBsFuO9BAKubApl8Ww6oPo8izWNDM6iwF7nFuYpDNl5nPDVKpG3Gk01YQzu/cdUaXPl97/2qx/l5u7XQ6nUzGq+PxO59un/9k+/zHX61/eG360TfXNtWN4sz18vWvy7NfZGev99/4Ur32/ODbvwEPyAIj36pAoQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"linting picture\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-d766e.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-13239.png 855w,\n/static/lintingpic-408e8e46351809a2a211494fb1bf74ae-141ef.png 970w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>TernJS + Autocomplete</h3>\n<p>Linters are great for telling you what not to do, but can’t give you much guidance on what you actually are able to do.  Fortunately we have other tools for that.  <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern.js</a> is a fantastic library that provides “intellisense” style autocompleting for JavaScript code, along with other IDE-like features including documentation links and refactoring support. It’s not perfect, since JavaScript’s nondeterministic syntax sometimes makes it hard to tell what properties a variable will actually have at runtime, but it takes a good shot at it and is able to go pretty far, especially for libraries where it can expose the full API to you within the editor.  To get the most out of Tern, you’ll need to set up a Tern project definition, where you can specify any files that you always want loaded, and any plugins you want to use. The preloaded files is useful if you’re making global references to a namespace or library, and the plugins can give you support for module systems, so that you can handle references that are passed into a module from a different file in code using requireJS or Angular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ternjs-46e25e5899958f3bd960e5692375a92b.gif\" alt=\"ternjs picture\"></p>\n<h3>Snippets</h3>\n<p>JavaScript development, especially on the front end, can involve a lot of repetitive boilerplate code<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">5</a></sup>.  Whether it’s module boilerplate like AMD require/define wrappers, library boilerplate like directive definitions in Angular or a Model definition in Backbone, or our own favorite patterns that we repeat a lot, we end up writing a lot of code over and over again.  Snippets are a great way to accomplish that.  They were one of the key features of Textmate when it first became popular.  Today they’re built in to Sublime Text and Atom, and there are popular libraries for both <a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet\">Emacs</a> to simulate the same functionality.</p>\n<p>Snippets allow you to define templates for common boilerplate code, allowing you to quickly insert repetitive content, including adding hooks for text that will vary across uses.  For instance here’s a snippet I have defined for creating a new AMD module<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#A new AMD define module\nsnippet dfn\ndefine([$1],function($2) {\n    $0  \n});\nendsnippet</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This allows me to type <em>dfn&#x3C;tab></em> at any time to expand out the template.  Initially my cursor will be in spot <code class=\"language-text\">$1</code>, and I can then enter text and tab to spot <code class=\"language-text\">$2</code>, with my final tab ending me at <code class=\"language-text\">$0</code>.  Snippet libraries can also provide other functionality like functions to show the current time, filename, or other contextual information.   Some can also mirror text so that you can enter a string once and have it appear throughout the template.  It can be a great time saver when you’re chugging through the boilerplate code of your project.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to implement JavaScript syntax checking definitely check out <a href=\"http://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jshint.com/\">jsHint</a>.  They both offer a lot more options and flexibility than <a href=\"http://www.jslint.com/\">jsLint</a>, the pioneer in this area.  It’s pretty easy to find an integration plugin for most common editors through those websites or Google, but <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntasticsu\">Syntastic</a> for Vim and <a href=\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3j\">Sublime Linter</a> for Sublime Text come especially recommended and have the advantage of supporting all 3 major JavaScript linters as well as syntax checking for multiple languages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern’s website</a> has great documentation and links to the editor specific implementations for different editors.  If you’re a Vim user I’d also recommend taking a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe\">YouCompleteMe</a> for an improved autocomplete interface that works well with Tern and UltiSnips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For snippet libraries, you can take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">UltiSnips</a> for Vim and <a href=\"https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet\">Yasnippet</a> for Emacs.  If you want an application agnostic snippet solution, <a href=\"http://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a> is a documentation management program for OSX that also has a rich snippet component you can use in any program the same way you’d use an editor specific solution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:0\">\n        <p> Other than the lack of an official Tern plugin for Atom\n        <a href=\"#fnref:0\" title=\"return to article\"> ↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1\">\n        <p>\n        Sublime Text and Atom provide pretty reasonable defaults.

It’s all about knowing which ones to use in which situations.  In my series from this summer on <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/learning-vim-in-2014/\">learning Vim</a>, I focused a lot on the different tools Vim provides for solving problems.  Today I’ll show how I put some of those tools together to actually be more productive.</p>\n<p>A good tool should allow you to focus on your problem while using it, without making you spend a lot of time thinking about extraneous things. File switching is an area in text editing that can really slow you down if you let it.  The first file switching method that most Vim users is the simple <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command to open a file.  Technically it’s the only command you need for file switching, since you can use it to open up any file you want and start editing it.  But doing so requires you to essentially internalize the complete structure of your file system and type out full paths every time.  On a large project with nested directories that becomes a significant mental load and use of time, even if you’re taking advantage of Vim’s tab completion features. And it’s a mental load that’s inessential to the task at hand.  You need to recall the precise layout of your file structure every time only because the tool isn’t able to make things easier for you.</p>\n<p>Fortunately Vim is able to make easier things easier for you when you use the right tool for the job.  That means rather than using one file switching strategy to rule them all, we can combine several tools to reduce the mental load on us and focus on our code or writing. I’ll specifically look at a few common scenarios and my approach for each.  This isn’t the only workflow you can use to address these scenarios, but hopefully it will inspire you to improve your own Vim workflow.  So here are the different scenarios:</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file with a name I know</h4>\n<img src=\"ctrlp\" class=\"full-width\" alt =\"ctrlp screenshot\">\n<p>When you’re moving to a file with a name that you know, it’s hard to beat the power of a fuzzy finding plugin like <a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a>.  CtrlP allows me to type in the name of a file without remembering or typing a long directory path and instantly get a list of potential files.  Usually the file I’m looking for is the top hit.  </p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file, but I don’t know what it’s called</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-548f7.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75.6190476190476%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"NerdTree screenshot\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-13239.png 855w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/nerdtree-f758239e22215a1a088d5d133db80d1a-548f7.png 2100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>This scenario happens most often on projects that you’re unfamiliar with and just getting into.  You’re looking for some functionality, but don’t know exactly what it’s called within the project and need to look through the file system for hints.  In this case you need a directory browsing tool.  Vim bundles <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075\">netrw</a> by default and it’s a good starting place.  If you have issues with netrw, many people install <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a> as an alternative file explorer.  I personally don’t use NerdTree very often these days.  Most of my work over the last year or so has been on one large project or smaller experimental projects and I haven’t needed it.  But it’s been very useful when I’ve cloned down a github repository to look it over or make changes.  It’s the best way to quickly get the lay of the land of a project within Vim, and to find a specific file before you really know what you’re looking for.</p>\n<h4>I want to move to a file that I already have open</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-157c6.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Buffer list\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-13239.png 855w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/bufferlist-889d10621b12f6cd57d28562b9d9e8bd-157c6.png 2080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>A common scenario in Vim involves moving back and forth between 2 files, possibly a file and its corresponding test file.  If you don’t want to use splits, that means you’ll want a quick command to move between open files.  Fortunately Vim keeps a list of active buffers open.  When I’m only flipping between 2 files I’ll usually use the <code class=\"language-text\">:bprev</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">:bnext</code> commands, which I’ve aliased to <code class=\"language-text\">[b</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">]b</code> <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. If I have more than a few files open though I’ll usually either use <code class=\"language-text\">:b</code> and type the name of the file, or just use ctrlp again, which doesn’t require me to remember if the file I wasn’t is actually already open or not.</p>\n<h4>I want to move back to the place I just was</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6964c.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.40625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"indy\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6fbc3.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-da4c7.jpg 143w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-1d39e.jpg 285w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6fbc3.jpg 570w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-9d77e.jpg 855w,\n/static/indy-46a8e0095062fcaf00ddde565ebaa717-6964c.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>“Rabbit Holing” happens to me all the time when I’m working on code.  I start looking at one thing, then look at code related to that, and before I know it I’m 4 files deep following a chain of stuff I’m debugging.  Oftentime I want to move back up that chain.  I could of course remember what files I opened and use one of the methods above, but that requires me to internalize the memory of events.  The command that maps best to my desire to move back up the chain is using Vim’s jumplist.  Vim keeps track of every “jump” you make within a window or split, and allows you to move back up and down that jump list as you like, both within files and across them. The commands to move up and down the jump list are mapped to <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-o&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;c-i&gt;</code> by default.  When I use them I don’t have to keep track of what files I’m moving across or even if I’m switching files at all.  I can just investigate my issue and have confidence that I’ll be able to get back.  Think of it as tying down a rope before you dive into a cave full of snakes.</p>\n<h4>I want to create a new file</h4>\n<p>Creating a new file means that we finally find a use for the basic <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code> command.  Because you need to specify a full directory path anyway when you’re creating a file, it makes sense to use the basic Vim commands here.  If you need to create a directory to put the file in, you can use the shell command with <code class=\"language-text\">:!mkdir &lt;path/to/dir&gt;</code>.  While writing this piece I learned that ctrlp has the ability to create a new directory path and file in a single command, which is a nice touch.  But you lose out on Vim’s autocompletion of paths if you’re creating a directory nested in existing directories.  I find the builtins to be simplest here.</p>\n<h4>I want to edit a specific piece of code, but don’t know what file it’s in</h4>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-ed99b.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.75988428158149%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAPCAIAAABr+ngCAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACkklEQVQoz1WSeW/aMBjG8++knVVLxxVK7thOHCeQw0mAAi1QytruUK+pXXdoWhnrNmi6T9DPvTcg7ZB+evK8b2zHfmLhZvr+64/ZYpEtsmxxe5dlv4D54m6+yK6ns9m37/PbvA/lz0UGCh74cj29v78XxLqkqqqsyHVJUhRZURWgWquXxS2xLotbUu6rNVCgItZK1Ro0Hz152uvvCrqJKGOYWMS2bUqJZdsOtakNT0QsVTcVzQDAaAZSdUPWDN3EpYq4OxgJholdzwUoc2AaYyz3DnUYIzbFFrWoAwYRe4ll2TDMlVXt7PytQGwWpe0wSniSBjwJeRryJIpTnrSgE6ctKIOIhzxuBpEfAjxO27Dc8cmpoOk6IQhh00QmGEwQwQhjBFutyyro6tgrVn5LUtbWN/PJJsKwcCMIm37Y8AMgXz4IG0HT833Pbzb8qAmlH8I3medR5rqNpm7ol++uIDCDuZBUHhIIqONQAxMTEx0BGAzkYiAMmUmKCqcFU3hePDk9E0xsOcyzKAQDIbm2w6jjwpEIdSzKiLXUPDPIicFQQhkYSdEuLq8EyrxOt5e0OkmrFcUxT5IkhZzSiMc8j21JnEByOUneT9IW8xofPn4SYCfwqwHNRLKqi5Jek/SyKJWAqlQW5XJNLlbrpRxpRaUmP35WeHN8JgR+YzxIhn0+6vNBNxr2eL8T7GyHO91otxtCB8pBjw960bAfLw0f7STtmN3MPguQ4uHBYLy3PdnbfrUXHQyjo3HnaL9zOG5Phgko8GKUgr6cdOEVmNcHvf0Bz+ZToVCsrG9WNorVjefVv/oPhWWzUBT/sFmqPXi4tj85EmzfMS2saSbcWLi9/4M1fWl0JCv6CsgZUVI35dOL89/WcbldvwE1qAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Ag.vim\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-13239.png 855w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/agvim-a01c0db5bdb62c7f983a8d508ff140cd-ed99b.png 2074w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<p>Finally, possibly the most common scenario for me is when I know I have a particular piece of code I need to edit, but don’t have it mapped to a particular file in my head.  Rather than forcing myself to recall the file, the easiest path is to let Vim take the information I know and help me out.  Specifically I use Ag.vim for code search within projects.  It is a wrapper around Ag, a <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">fantastic code search program based on Ack</a>.  It allows me to enter a search term, and then pulls up all occurrences of that term within my project.  One of it’s best features is filtering by file type, which allows me to type something like <code class=\"language-text\">:Ag --less &quot;\\.widget&quot;</code> and search my LESS files for all rules effecting the class <code class=\"language-text\">.widget</code>.  </p>\n<h3>Let Vim Work For You</h3>\n<p>The workflow I described is not the “one true way” to navigate files in Vim.  Some people hate plugins and will prefer to use <code class=\"language-text\">:e</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">:b</code>, and netrw for everything. You can certainly do many of the things above with NerdTree or CtrlP if you prefer to simplify to one tool.  And <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite</a> is an attempt to pull almost all of these scenarios into one tool.  The point is to be aware of the inessential work created in the different scenarios you face when coding and offload the work to Vim in a way that makes sense to you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/\">Oil and Vinegar</a> is a nice Vimcasts article on how to make NerdTree work well with multiple splits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I wrote a more <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/07/learning-vim-in-2014-working-with-files/\">introductory post</a> this summer on the tools you can use to manage files in Vim.

No matter how many cases you hit, somebody will want to do something you don’t support, will find your solution for their problem confusing, or they’ll try to use your tool in a way you never imagined. Vim tries to deal with situations like that in 2 ways.  First by making it easy to <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/14/learning-vim-in-2014-configuring-vim/\">configure</a>, and second by making it easy to extend.

They’re a powerful tool, and a key part of what has helped Vim remain relevant for 23 years, even as the computing world has changed dramatically around it.  They allow Vim to support languages that didn’t exist the last time its core was updated, handle niche use cases that would never get solutions in the main Vim distribution, and also allow for powerful new features that benefit all users.</p>\n<p>Your key focus when it comes to Vim plugins should be identifying your needs and finding plugins to fit them.  Don’t just toss every plugin you see recommended somewhere into your .vim/bundle folder.  Plugins have costs; they slow down file loads, can fill up the key mapping space, and add complexity for users.  But they’re also extremely powerful, and I recommend that everyone who controls their development environment think about using at least a few.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Management: Hello Vundle</h3>\n<p>Before you install anything, you’re going to need a strategy for managing your plugins.  Plugin management for Vim has a bit of a troubled history.  There’s never been an official plugin management solution, and unlike Sublime Text’s Package Control, there wasn’t a simple, easy to use solution that the community standardized.  Instead, plugins were initially just placed into the .vim folder or elsewhere and then sourced in ~/.vimrc.  To allow for download or installation, authors used a variety of compression formats, including a Vim specific Vimball format.  Early efforts to standardize a process didn’t go particulary well.</p>\n<p>That changed with the rise of Github and Tim Pope’s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\">Pathogen</a>.  Pathogen was the first plugin manager to make it relatively simple to include new plugins, by encouraging a standard directory format and installation process (using git repositories).  It began a standardization process that now means pretty much any modern Vim plugin can be installed with Pathogen without modification.</p>\n<p>Despite Pathogen’s historical significance, in 2014 you should use <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Vundle</a>, not Pathogen, to manage your plugins.  Vundle is an easy to use plugin manager that is compatible with the Pathogen format.  Vundle improves on Pathogen in several ways.  It allows you to list the plugins you want to use in your vimrc file, then will pull them down and install them for you.  So adding and removing plugins is just a configuration change, and it’s always easy to see which ones you’re currently using.  It makes it easy to pull plugins from a variety of sources, but optimizes for Github, and Vim.org.  Since roughly 99% of plugins that most users will need are available from one of those sources, this is extremely convenient.  You can find full documentation for using Vundle in its <a href=\"https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\">Github repo</a>, but trust me, it’s the best option out there for 99% of users.</p>\n<h3>What Can Plugins do for you?</h3>\n<p>Before you start installing plugins, it’s worth thinking about what you need from them.  There are a few main purposes for using plugins.  I’m including a few examples of each to get you started as you figure out which plugins make sense for you.</p>\n<h4>Let Vim Get Your Files In Order</h4>\n<p>File management plugins are some of the most important plugins you can use with Vim.  Vim’s built-in file management is pretty weak in some ways compared to editors like Sublime Text and TextMate.  Plugins can fill that gap.  The plugins listed below show several approaches to file management.  There’s plenty of overlap in functionality here, but they’re all worth trying to see which ones fit your style.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim\">CtrlP</a> is probably my most used Vim plugin.  It provides fuzzy finding capabilities for Vim, to allow you to search for files in a similar way to Sublime Text’s “Go To Anything” bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim\">Ack.vim</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rking/ag.vim\">Ag.vim</a> are plugins to connect Vim with Ack and Ag respectively.  If you’re not using one of these tools for code search, you <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2013/11/25/a-look-at-ack/\">really should be</a>.  They’re much faster than grep or an IDE’s built in search.  These plugins provide seamless integration for each within Vim, allowing you to easily jump to the code you’re searching on, opening new tabs or splits if you like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim\">Unite.vim</a> is an interesting attempt to combine the functionality of plugins like ctrlp, ack.vim and others into a single “omnisearch” interface.  I personally found it a bit unintuitive and poorly documented, but some people <a href=\"http://www.codeography.com/2013/06/17/replacing-all-the-things-with-unite-vim.html\">swear by it</a>. If you are able to make sense of it, it’s certainly a great concept to pull in related functionality into a single interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">The NERDTree</a> is one of the most popular Vim plugins out there.  It provides a more traditional side-drawer style navigation interface to complement Vim’s other navigation options.  I personally prefer a “search over specifying” navigation style, so ctrlp and ack.vim work better for me.  But I keep NERDTree around for looking at other people’s code in new projects, when I want to look around a directory to see what’s available and how it’s structured before diving in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist\">Projectionist.vim</a> is something I’ve just begun to look into.  It’s an interesting approach by Tim Pope to provide a more intuitive way to navigate structured projects.  Rather than fuzzy finding or sidebars, Projectionist invites you to create categories of files that you can open files from (for instance  model, view and controller files in a BackboneJS project).  This gives you the simplicity of traditional Vim file path opens while removing some of the memorization and clutter from the process.  Projectionist also allows you to specify alternate files for each file. That allows you to, for instance, jump quickly from a file to its unit test file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Building On Vim’s Built In Language</h4>\n<p>Another interesting class of Vim plugins are plugins that extend Vim’s existing language concepts.  In my past few posts I’ve looked at how Vim is intended to be used by <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/\">combining composable commands with motions and text objects</a>, then efficiently <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">repeating that process when possible</a>.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround\">Surround.vim</a> is another plugin by Tim Pope.  It provides an extra command to use with Vim’s built in text objects. That command, <code class=\"language-text\">ys</code> allows you to surround a text object with some sort of enclosing tag. So <code class=\"language-text\">ysiw&#39;</code> surrounds the current word with <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">ysip&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</code> surrounds the current paragraph with <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags.  There’s also a separate command to replace surrounding characters with different ones.  It’s extremely useful, especially for HTML editing and quoting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary\">commentary.vim</a> adds a “commenting” action, <code class=\"language-text\">gc</code> that can be used with existing motions.  So <code class=\"language-text\">gcc</code> comments out the current line, <code class=\"language-text\">gcG</code> comments out the remainder of a file, and so on.  This is yet another Tim Pope plugin.  I promise I’m not trying to make up for recommending Vundle over Pathogen, the guy has just been prolific.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat\">Repeat.vim</a> is one final Tim Pope plugin for now.  Repeat allows you to extend the <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> command to work with user created commands.  It works with surround and commentary out of the box, but you can also set it up to work with your own commands. <a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/16/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-art/\">The . command is one of the most important Vim commands</a>, so being able to use it in more situations is definitely a win.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user\">vim-text-obj-user</a> is an interesting project to make it easy to create plugins that define custom text objects which then can be used with Vim commands like any other text object.  If that sounds scary to you, you can also take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user/wiki\">list</a> of plugins already built with the project, and use any that will be useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-4fae5.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 570px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.0145934676859%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAIAAADtbgqsAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACKUlEQVQoz2WRXWvTUBjHT9OsTudERNGrrW4DcWly0jVJk7S1rh1lOtsKop2gbgMVBfViFzIFP4BOkF574YcSRPbSF9asrUma1KZ0ffecZNShD38ezoHzO//nBfz88T2fy+X293N2KIpSqVTK5bKmaflC4cOX7Pts9t32562P26ubb5efv1p5+fr2izeZza1PX78B9LTdbne7XZQ7nc7Qjv5ggPIvTb8cWQLXaIKCAGmeARQWgQ5XZrl0Bhwqh42G1WodIR4BAzv6/T46V1V1Op4CTIRkZYKRCCi5Ic5jrAzmGD6zBorFIqrSsizk7DDOF7az5l1KAhgm6CCY57AoLHyd8XH3HwNFKSFeVVWn+JOwquvTsTsAhsiFEAFFFysBnwAo/i9crVT2dveq1Wqj0ej1ev/AU7EVwEbH+UXSH3FqdjEyhq/6+AdP8MBKBwetVmt4Io5hTZuKJwkYOY2dQwTFAwo5C24MU8HVdYC2sruzg2xRw8jZaduBdcOYSaTG/NJZ8eakGJ5YEEiac9McyWBnDNdqhmmazWazY4dTuQPXTHM2kQJ0+Fzk1oVgeCIgnPFzp5iABwrHcN20RhsajBZlf6HXanOJtIsWPXx0HEoeViYZEcwjfzww8eEasKwjGx7+37NRr3sTaQL6L4YXCb+EG77OIbl9QeBF8AZQiqXfhmFomqnrI6GrZZqFfH55/eklOXpewDOb5G/A5D32bkaKx+QA9Wzj0R9Ah5z8qrujIAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Vim side by side styles\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-d766e.png\" srcset=\"/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-a6b6e.png 143w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-8e488.png 285w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-d766e.png 570w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-13239.png 855w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-cab6d.png 1140w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-71f14.png 1710w,\n/static/vimvisuals-521ac294b2640855286b37094b806af3-4fae5.png 2878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<h4>Help Vim Look Good</h4>\n<p>One of the best uses for plugins is making Vim a bit easier on the eyes. We can do a lot to change Vim’s default look and feel.  For instance the screenshot above shows what MacVim looks like with and without loading my ~/.vimrc file and plugins.  If you’re a writer or developer, you may be looking at Vim for as much as 8-10 hours a day.  So make it something you’re happy to look at.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Syntax highlighting plugins are one of the main things you can use to make your code easier to read.  Vim packages syntax highlighting for many common languages, but for less mainstream languages you’ll need to download plugins to get syntax highlighting.  These plugins often may contain other niceties for the language, like syntax checking or support for compiling from within Vim.  For instance I use plugins for <a href=\"https://github.com/groenewege/vim-less\">Less</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script\">CoffeeScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown\">Markdown</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Colorschemes are also an important part of helping Vim look its best.  Most distributions of Vim bundle several colorschemes, but the most popular ones come as plugins.  If you’re somebody who needs to know that somebody else has sweated the details of the tools you use so that you don’t have to, I recommend <a href=\"http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized\">Solarized</a>, a color scheme based on the relationships between different colors and designed to echo the readability of words on paper.  If you like to try different things and have more options, consider looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/chriskempson/base16\">Base16</a>, a project to standardize color scheme creation for multiple editors.  The advantage of both of these schemes is that they’re available for pretty much any editor or tool you’d want to use alongside or in place of Vim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/reedes/vim-thematic\">Thematic</a> is a tool to allow you to manage your visual schemes.  So if you like to use different color schemes or fonts in different situations, Thematic can make that easy. You can define a set of “themes”, and then switch between them whenever you feel like it.  As somebody who uses Vim for both writing and programming, it’s nice to be able to use different themes for different situations.  I currently use Solarized for code, and the Pencil theme for writing.  Thematic and Pencil are two of a <a href=\"http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/reed-esau-s-growing-list-of-vim-plugins-for-writers\">wide variety of plugins for writers</a> that Reed Esau has written.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\">Airline</a> is a plugin to pretty up your status bar.  It creates the nice triangular effects in the image above, and integrates with other plugins to show helpful information in the status bar.  It does require modified fonts to use though, so you’ll need to have pretty full control of the system you’re on to use this one.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Understand Your Code</h4>\n<p>Vim is not an IDE.  By default it doesn’t understand much about code, and very little about specific languages.  It offloads that knowledge to the operating system, through things like <code class=\"language-text\">:make</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ctags</code>, and to plugins.  Here are a few plugins that can help make Vim a bit more “code aware”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\">Syntastic</a> is a syntax checking plugin for Vim that integrates with external syntax checkers to provide in-editor feedback on your code as you make changes.  For instance, it can integrate with jshint, llvm or javac to provide immediate feedback on a file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe\">YouCompleteMe</a> is a code completion engine for Vim that builds on Vim’s built in autocomplete features to offer “smart completion” for as many situations as possible.  It can integrate with Clang, Jedi, Omnisharp, and Vim’s omnicompletion in order to bring smart autocomplete to a variety of languages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive\">Fugitive</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter\">Git-gutter</a> are 2 plugins that bring Git integration into Vim.  Fugitive provides a wrapper around the Git executable to allow you to easily manage your git actions from within Vim. GitGutter focuses on individual files and lets you see where you’ve made uncommited modifications in the current file.  They complement each other well, and are both very useful for heavy Git users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate\">delimitMate</a> is a simple plugin that removes a huge annoyance by auto inserting matching braces and brackets in a smart, intuitive way.  Lack of auto brace insertion was a big mental hurdle for me coming from Sublime Text.  DelimitMate makes things work the way I expect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language specific plugins are another plugin group worth investigating.  There are way too many examples to list here, but one that I use and enjoy is <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">TernJs</a>, a code intelligence plugin for Javascript that you can use with something like YouCompleteMe to get the type of IDE style autocompletion that is very rare for Javascript code.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Help Vim Play Nice With Others</h4>\n<p>Some plugins exist to provide tighter integration between Vim and external programs.  We’ve already touched on a few of those, like Ack.vim and Syntastic.  Vim is intended to follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well and working well with other programs.  Integration plugins allow for deeper versions of that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator\">Tmux Navigator</a> is a must have plugin for <a href=\"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/\">Tmux</a> users.  It allows you to easily move between tmux and Vim splits using a single set of keyboard mappings.  It lets Vim and tmux work together in a completely natural way, without the user having to keep track of where one ends and the other begins.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash.vim</a> is an OSX only plugin that provides integration with Dash.app, a documentation manager app for OSX, making it easy to look up library method definitions from within Vim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Grant Vim Superpowers</h4>\n<p>The last category of plugins are scripts that allow Vim to do things that are totally different than anything it can do on its own.  These may be features pulled from other editors, or features inspired by Vim but implemented differently than the Vim core.  These can be pretty amazing, but I’d be careful with them to start.  You’ll want to learn how Vim works before piling a bunch of big extensions on top of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips\">Ultisnips</a> allows Vim to use Textmate like “snippets” that allow you to save canned templates of code or text, then insert and modify them whenever you’re ready.  If this sounds interesting, I’d recommend checking out the recent <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-ultisnips/\">Vimcast</a> episodes where Drew explores Ultisnips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion\">EasyMotion</a> is a plugin that introduces a new type of movement to Vim.  It creates alternative versions of the Vim movements like <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">w</code> that allow you to find a character or word anywhere on the screen, and specify it by using a key character that temporarily appears on the screen in place of each possible target character.

It lists some categories similar to what I have above and sorts plugins by popularity.
