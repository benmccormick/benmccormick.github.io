You can delay it for a while, and you can try to replace them with all sorts of things, including email, IM, wikis, and guessing people’s intentions.  Doing so is, of course, completely worthwhile.  Eventually though, meetings are inevitable.</p>\n<p>There are several different flavors of meetings.  There are decision-making meetings, where a crowd of people gather together, either to argue, watch other people argue, or to carefully watch the hands of the clock make their way around its circumference. There are Powerpoint meetings, wherein an individual gathers his victims (sorry was that coworkers?) together and proceeds to read bullet points from a set of slides to them.  There is also the conference call meeting, which has led many people to a deeper appreciation for the mute button on their phone.  Rarest of all is the actual productive meeting, where information is exchanged, decisions are made, and life continues without irreparable harm.</p>\n<p>So is there any hope for productive meetings?  It’s important to realize that a meeting should be the last resort for most things.  Meetings are blocking synchronous activities.  Everyone gives up a set piece of time and that time is the same for everyone. The meeting length is limited by the attendee most willing to keep talking. Generally that time cannot be used for anything else by the people involved in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Programmers have several options for handling long running blocking operations while coding.  The first is the naive approach.  The following coffeescript is an example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\">meetingDone <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">false</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># are we done yet?</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">until</span> meetingDone\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token function\">person1Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person2Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person3Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token function\">longRunningMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">#Do whatever's next, plus anything that depends on the meeting</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">followUpOnMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is how things often work when it comes to meetings, but that code wouldn’t last long in a professional software environment.  Everything grinds to a halt until the meeting is done, which keeps the program from doing anything else or responding to user input.</p>\n<p>A second option while coding is the multi-threaded approach.  In coffeescript that looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Do meeting tasks in a worker thread</span>\nmeeting <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Worker</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"meeting.js\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># When the meeting is done, act on a follow up message</span>\nmeeting<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>addEventListener <span class=\"token string\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">followUpOnMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nmeeting<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>postMessage <span class=\"token string\">\"Start\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># get back to work right away</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is equivalent in the real world to limiting the people in a meeting.  Rather than allowing a meeting to block all our resources, we put only some of our resources into the meeting and then pass the results of the meeting on to the rest of the team once the meeting is complete.</p>\n<p>This is an important principle for meetings. Meetings should contain the minimum amount of people needed to accomplish their purpose.  When meetings grow beyond that size (due to laziness, politics, process or confusion) they begin to become exponentially less productive.</p>\n<p>Of course multi-threaded approaches can still suffer the same issues as single threaded programs if you try to do too much.  If the worker thread in the example above looks like the code below, we will not have gained much.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># meeting.coffee</span>\nself<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>addEventListener <span class=\"token string\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    somebodyHasMadeADecision <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">false</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># are we done yet?</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">until</span> somebodyHasMadeADecision\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span>  <span class=\"token function\">person1Indecisive</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person2Scared</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person3Clueless</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n            <span class=\"token function\">longRunningMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n    self<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>postMessage <span class=\"token string\">\"meeting is finally done\"</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>No matter who is involved it’s important for meetings to have a clear purpose.  Just like you wouldn’t put all of your program’s logic inside a single worker thread, the best meetings are simple, single purposed, and lightweight, based on clear, answerable questions.</p>\n<p>There’s a third approach that programmers can take to long running processes.  They can use asynchronous operations, as shown below using promise notation.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># define an email response function</span>\nreadResponses <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>message<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    respond <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">readEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> respond <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> <span class=\"token function\">respondToEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">sendEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"importantTopic\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># responses and respond if necessary</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>readResponses<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># read more responses and respond if necessary</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>readResponses<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># follow up when the responses are done</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>done followUpOnMeeting\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># After email we can go back to work right away</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This async approach doesn’t delegate different resources for different problems, instead we change how we’re thinking about long running operations.  Rather than tying up resources to deal with them, we make them a separate operation that can be consumed and responded to when our program has available time. You can’t do that with meetings.</p>\n<p>By contrast, email, documentation, and other “information artifacts” can be consumed asynchronously, at different paces and different times by different people. They don’t block off any particular time that might need to be devoted to other things.  So Powerpoint meetings can become an email that contains a Powerpoint or wiki page, followed if necessary by clarifying questions which people can work through at their own pace. Decision meetings can become a back and forth discussion on a mailing list, that the interested parties can participate in as they have time and motivation.  It removes blocking issues completely by removing the requirement of all participants being on the same time schedule.</p>\n<p>So the takeaways from this coffee flavored reflection on meetings:  Async operations are your friends.  Don’t have meetings.  If you do, keep them short, small, and focused. Friends don’t let friends read their powerpoint slides line by line.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/12/30/meetings-and-concurrency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Book Review","Software Teams"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Talking with Tech Leads","description":"A book review of Talking with Tech Leads","layout":"post","path":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads","date":"2015-06-15T11:30:44+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Can we be honest for a moment?

I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"ten-things-js,jest-git,orthogonality-css-js","topics":["Interviewing","Software Teams"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"favorite-interview","title":"My Favorite Interview Question","description":"How does the Internet work anyway?","layout":"post","path":"/2017/07/24/my-favorite-interview-question/","date":"2017-07-24T11:45:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I have a favorite question to ask in interviews for web developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How does the internet work?  In other words, when I open a browser and enter a url then hit enter, and a website shows up on my screen what can you tell me about what is happening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usually I get one of a few responses:</p>\n<h4>1. The clueless shrug</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uh….  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have no idea what to do with the question.  Things get awkward. This is mostly for junior positions but still isn’t the best sign.  Sometimes a few prods will get things back on track.</p>\n<h4>2. The bare minimum</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is asking a server for the site and the server sends you the site.    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people can give a very basic response, but don’t give a lot of details.  This again mostly corresponds to less experienced devs and can be fine as a starting spot with some follow-up questions.</p>\n<h4>3. The CliffNotes</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your browser sends an HTTP request which gets routed through a local modem/router and gets sent to a name server for its url extension.  That name server routes the request to the correct IP address, which will resolve to some sort of web server.  That server will serve up either some static files, or run some backend code in order to generate a resource (probably an html page).  When the HTML page is returned, your browser will parse it, which will likely generate more requests, and the cycle will repeat.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people know how some of this works, maybe with a few hazy areas and can explain it in a reasonably straightforward way.  An explanation like this is a great start.</p>\n<h4>4. The Geek-out</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><Some variation on the previous answer... followed by:> Let me tell you all about my in depth knowledge of &#x3C;HTTP<em>network routing</em>JavaScript parsing/TCP/other related topic>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people dive in and explode with information.  </p>\n<h3>So why is this a good interview question again?</h3>\n<p>So which answer is best?  The geek-out right?  Well… its great when somebody gets there, but in my mind this question is more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to make the case that this is a pretty bad interview question.  It’s not clear what the expected answer is.  When I ask it in junior dev interviews, they often don’t have much of a clue how to answer it.  And it’s not strictly answerable in full detail by pretty much anyone.  But I’d argue that those things actually end up being strengths.  I like this question for 5 reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the candidate’s ability to deal with ambiguity.</strong>  The question is intentionally vague and open ended.  Am I just looking for a perfunctory response like “it gets a resource from a server”?  Do I want a deep dive into how DNS works?  It’s ambiguous.  Candidates can respond to that ambiguity in one of a few ways.  </p>\n<p>They can freeze because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.  </p>\n<p>They can ask a clarifying question.  </p>\n<p>They can make a guess at what I want and start going down that road, while reading my reaction to see if they’re still on track.  </p>\n<p>Or they can decide they know what I want (or what they want to tell me) and shoot off like a rocket (potentially for a very long time).</p>\n<p>This is super useful information in an interview because developers deal with ambiguity all the time.  When a candidate encounters unclear requirements from a product manager, or unclear documentation from another developer, it’s good to have an idea how they’ll respond<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the breadth of a candidates knowledge.</strong> - For the most part, when I interview people, I ask them questions about the role they’re applying for:  Front-End Dev, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, etc.  But this question gives a candidate the chance to show that they understand what’s happening up and down the web stack from the code they interact with the most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate a chance to explain a complex technical topic.</strong> - In my mind, good communication ability is the most important skill for a developer once they’ve achieved a minimum level of technical competence.  Being able to talk about problems and solutions clearly and explain them to a variety of audiences matters, and it matters a lot.  Can the candidate summarize a complex technical topic without getting bogged down in details?  Are they communicating with me (verbally or otherwise) to make sure I’m following their explanation?  Or are they fading off into a rambling run-on explanation of a trivial detail without any big picture context?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It forces the candidate to confront something they don’t know.</strong> - The internet is a perfect example of the Isaac Newton quote about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants\">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>.  It is the culmination of 50+ years of research and work on networked computer systems.  No candidate I interview for a web development position is going to understand every detail of how it works, because you can always go a layer deeper in the stack or afield into crazier edge case behavior.  So at some point in questioning (possibly very early), this question exhausts every candidate’s knowledge.  The question is how do they react?  Some candidates start guessing at things.  Some admit they don’t know.  Some try to skirt around areas they don’t feel confident in and work at avoiding any questions where they would have to admit they don’t know something.  And some will actually ask me how part of the system works.  This again is helpful because “not knowing the answer” is such a common experience in real world web dev.  It’s great to have some clues to how a candidate handles that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate an opportunity to show off what they know.</strong>  I’ve gotten some amazing answers to this question.  It turns out some candidates actually know a lot about networking and HTTP/TCP/nameservers.  Some can give detailed answers about browsers and how they parse resources and display the DOM.  Maybe they just know a lot of random trivia about URLs and DNS.  Regardless, this is a chance to show off and prove that they’ve delved deep into something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think every interview question should be like this one.  Most should probably directly relate to the work the candidate is doing, be clearly comparable in an objective way candidate to candidate, and not risk sending the interview down a 10 minute rabbit hole.  But this one is my favorite, and I think there’s a place for questions that show how a candidate might handle some real world lack of structure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336\">@ben336</a> to tell me your favorite interview question.

That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>\n<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>\n<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>\n<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>\n<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>\n<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>\n<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>\n<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>\n<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.  </li>\n<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>\n<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>\n<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>\n<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> and <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod\">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/\">pre-commit hooks</a>.  </p>\n<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>\n<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>\n<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>\n<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>\n<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/\">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I’ve gotten to work with plenty of non-devs who respect the need for good architecture.

You can delay it for a while, and you can try to replace them with all sorts of things, including email, IM, wikis, and guessing people’s intentions.  Doing so is, of course, completely worthwhile.  Eventually though, meetings are inevitable.</p>\n<p>There are several different flavors of meetings.  There are decision-making meetings, where a crowd of people gather together, either to argue, watch other people argue, or to carefully watch the hands of the clock make their way around its circumference. There are Powerpoint meetings, wherein an individual gathers his victims (sorry was that coworkers?) together and proceeds to read bullet points from a set of slides to them.  There is also the conference call meeting, which has led many people to a deeper appreciation for the mute button on their phone.  Rarest of all is the actual productive meeting, where information is exchanged, decisions are made, and life continues without irreparable harm.</p>\n<p>So is there any hope for productive meetings?  It’s important to realize that a meeting should be the last resort for most things.  Meetings are blocking synchronous activities.  Everyone gives up a set piece of time and that time is the same for everyone. The meeting length is limited by the attendee most willing to keep talking. Generally that time cannot be used for anything else by the people involved in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Programmers have several options for handling long running blocking operations while coding.  The first is the naive approach.  The following coffeescript is an example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\">meetingDone <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">false</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># are we done yet?</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">until</span> meetingDone\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token function\">person1Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person2Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person3Ready</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token function\">longRunningMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">#Do whatever's next, plus anything that depends on the meeting</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">followUpOnMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is how things often work when it comes to meetings, but that code wouldn’t last long in a professional software environment.  Everything grinds to a halt until the meeting is done, which keeps the program from doing anything else or responding to user input.</p>\n<p>A second option while coding is the multi-threaded approach.  In coffeescript that looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Do meeting tasks in a worker thread</span>\nmeeting <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Worker</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"meeting.js\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># When the meeting is done, act on a follow up message</span>\nmeeting<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>addEventListener <span class=\"token string\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">followUpOnMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nmeeting<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>postMessage <span class=\"token string\">\"Start\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># get back to work right away</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is equivalent in the real world to limiting the people in a meeting.  Rather than allowing a meeting to block all our resources, we put only some of our resources into the meeting and then pass the results of the meeting on to the rest of the team once the meeting is complete.</p>\n<p>This is an important principle for meetings. Meetings should contain the minimum amount of people needed to accomplish their purpose.  When meetings grow beyond that size (due to laziness, politics, process or confusion) they begin to become exponentially less productive.</p>\n<p>Of course multi-threaded approaches can still suffer the same issues as single threaded programs if you try to do too much.  If the worker thread in the example above looks like the code below, we will not have gained much.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># meeting.coffee</span>\nself<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>addEventListener <span class=\"token string\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>e<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    somebodyHasMadeADecision <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">false</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># are we done yet?</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">until</span> somebodyHasMadeADecision\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span>  <span class=\"token function\">person1Indecisive</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person2Scared</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token function\">person3Clueless</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n            <span class=\"token function\">longRunningMeeting</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n    self<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>postMessage <span class=\"token string\">\"meeting is finally done\"</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>No matter who is involved it’s important for meetings to have a clear purpose.  Just like you wouldn’t put all of your program’s logic inside a single worker thread, the best meetings are simple, single purposed, and lightweight, based on clear, answerable questions.</p>\n<p>There’s a third approach that programmers can take to long running processes.  They can use asynchronous operations, as shown below using promise notation.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"coffeescript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-coffeescript\"><code class=\"language-coffeescript\"><span class=\"token comment\"># define an email response function</span>\nreadResponses <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>message<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n    respond <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">readEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> respond <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> <span class=\"token function\">respondToEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">sendEmail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"importantTopic\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># responses and respond if necessary</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>readResponses<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># read more responses and respond if necessary</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>readResponses<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># follow up when the responses are done</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>done followUpOnMeeting\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># After email we can go back to work right away</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">backToWork</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This async approach doesn’t delegate different resources for different problems, instead we change how we’re thinking about long running operations.  Rather than tying up resources to deal with them, we make them a separate operation that can be consumed and responded to when our program has available time. You can’t do that with meetings.</p>\n<p>By contrast, email, documentation, and other “information artifacts” can be consumed asynchronously, at different paces and different times by different people. They don’t block off any particular time that might need to be devoted to other things.  So Powerpoint meetings can become an email that contains a Powerpoint or wiki page, followed if necessary by clarifying questions which people can work through at their own pace. Decision meetings can become a back and forth discussion on a mailing list, that the interested parties can participate in as they have time and motivation.  It removes blocking issues completely by removing the requirement of all participants being on the same time schedule.</p>\n<p>So the takeaways from this coffee flavored reflection on meetings:  Async operations are your friends.  Don’t have meetings.  If you do, keep them short, small, and focused. Friends don’t let friends read their powerpoint slides line by line.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2013/12/30/meetings-and-concurrency"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":null,"topics":["Book Review","Software Teams"],"category":"reviews","key":null,"title":"Book Review: Talking with Tech Leads","description":"A book review of Talking with Tech Leads","layout":"post","path":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads","date":"2015-06-15T11:30:44+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>Can we be honest for a moment?

I know that I love technology; at the same time I want to have real influence on the things that I’m building, and in most places it’s the product and people challenges that ultimately determine whether software projects succeed or fail, rather than the pure technical ones.  So what does it look like to build a career leading across these different areas? That’s the question that <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Talking with Tech Leads</a> tries to answer.</p>\n<p>Talking with Tech Leads is an eBook about what it’s like to pursue a middle path between the two sides of the false dichotomy above.  It’s structured as a series of interviews with “Tech Leads”, which the author defines as <a href=\"https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/\">a developer leading a development team</a>.  Each interview shares a series of questions, as well as an open space for interviewees to share more freeform thoughts and advice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What should a Tech Lead focus on and why?</li>\n<li>What has been your biggest challenge as a Tech Lead?</li>\n<li>Any time-management tips?</li>\n<li>How do you strike the right balance between writing code and dealing with other issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you would expect from a series of nearly forty interviews with the same structure, there is plenty of repetition across answers.  Themes emerge quickly: a need to look beyond code for solutions without losing sight of your technical skills, the importance of enabling your team members to succeed, and the need to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical participants in a business.  At the same time it’s clear that many of these individuals view their roles drastically differently despite superficially similar job descriptions.  Some focus on leading people, some on software architecture, and some on aligning business and technical objectives.  What the interviews expose are a wide and varied set of niches that fall between the traditional “Senior Developer” and “Management” career paths.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how this book would read to a seasoned tech lead.  I expect that it would be affirming to see how others have approached similar challenges, but I’m not sure it does a good enough job pulling the various threads from the interview into practical insights to provide much tangible big picture advice for current tech leads.  Instead it would likely be a collection of small useful ideas and nuggets.</p>\n<p>For a developer like myself who is still figuring out what it looks like to have a career in this industry though, this book is a tapestry of ideas and possibilities.  I’d recommend it to anyone who’s been underwhelmed by the extreme career paths that serve as the “path of least resistance” in some organizations, and want to become leaders without sacrificing their roots.</p>\n<p><em>You can purchase Talking with Tech Leads as an e-book through <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Leanpub</a> or as a paperback on <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1KQdC90\">Amazon</a></em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2015/06/15/book-review-talking-with-tech-leads"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"readNext":"ten-things-js,jest-git,orthogonality-css-js","topics":["Interviewing","Software Teams"],"category":"software-productivity","key":"favorite-interview","title":"My Favorite Interview Question","description":"How does the Internet work anyway?","layout":"post","path":"/2017/07/24/my-favorite-interview-question/","date":"2017-07-24T11:45:00+00:00","dontfeature":null,"isDraft":null},"html":"<p>I have a favorite question to ask in interviews for web developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How does the internet work?  In other words, when I open a browser and enter a url then hit enter, and a website shows up on my screen what can you tell me about what is happening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usually I get one of a few responses:</p>\n<h4>1. The clueless shrug</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uh….  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have no idea what to do with the question.  Things get awkward. This is mostly for junior positions but still isn’t the best sign.  Sometimes a few prods will get things back on track.</p>\n<h4>2. The bare minimum</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is asking a server for the site and the server sends you the site.    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people can give a very basic response, but don’t give a lot of details.  This again mostly corresponds to less experienced devs and can be fine as a starting spot with some follow-up questions.</p>\n<h4>3. The CliffNotes</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your browser sends an HTTP request which gets routed through a local modem/router and gets sent to a name server for its url extension.  That name server routes the request to the correct IP address, which will resolve to some sort of web server.  That server will serve up either some static files, or run some backend code in order to generate a resource (probably an html page).  When the HTML page is returned, your browser will parse it, which will likely generate more requests, and the cycle will repeat.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people know how some of this works, maybe with a few hazy areas and can explain it in a reasonably straightforward way.  An explanation like this is a great start.</p>\n<h4>4. The Geek-out</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><Some variation on the previous answer... followed by:> Let me tell you all about my in depth knowledge of &#x3C;HTTP<em>network routing</em>JavaScript parsing/TCP/other related topic>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people dive in and explode with information.  </p>\n<h3>So why is this a good interview question again?</h3>\n<p>So which answer is best?  The geek-out right?  Well… its great when somebody gets there, but in my mind this question is more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to make the case that this is a pretty bad interview question.  It’s not clear what the expected answer is.  When I ask it in junior dev interviews, they often don’t have much of a clue how to answer it.  And it’s not strictly answerable in full detail by pretty much anyone.  But I’d argue that those things actually end up being strengths.  I like this question for 5 reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the candidate’s ability to deal with ambiguity.</strong>  The question is intentionally vague and open ended.  Am I just looking for a perfunctory response like “it gets a resource from a server”?  Do I want a deep dive into how DNS works?  It’s ambiguous.  Candidates can respond to that ambiguity in one of a few ways.  </p>\n<p>They can freeze because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.  </p>\n<p>They can ask a clarifying question.  </p>\n<p>They can make a guess at what I want and start going down that road, while reading my reaction to see if they’re still on track.  </p>\n<p>Or they can decide they know what I want (or what they want to tell me) and shoot off like a rocket (potentially for a very long time).</p>\n<p>This is super useful information in an interview because developers deal with ambiguity all the time.  When a candidate encounters unclear requirements from a product manager, or unclear documentation from another developer, it’s good to have an idea how they’ll respond<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It tests the breadth of a candidates knowledge.</strong> - For the most part, when I interview people, I ask them questions about the role they’re applying for:  Front-End Dev, Backend Dev, QA Engineer, etc.  But this question gives a candidate the chance to show that they understand what’s happening up and down the web stack from the code they interact with the most.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate a chance to explain a complex technical topic.</strong> - In my mind, good communication ability is the most important skill for a developer once they’ve achieved a minimum level of technical competence.  Being able to talk about problems and solutions clearly and explain them to a variety of audiences matters, and it matters a lot.  Can the candidate summarize a complex technical topic without getting bogged down in details?  Are they communicating with me (verbally or otherwise) to make sure I’m following their explanation?  Or are they fading off into a rambling run-on explanation of a trivial detail without any big picture context?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It forces the candidate to confront something they don’t know.</strong> - The internet is a perfect example of the Isaac Newton quote about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants\">standing on the shoulders of giants</a>.  It is the culmination of 50+ years of research and work on networked computer systems.  No candidate I interview for a web development position is going to understand every detail of how it works, because you can always go a layer deeper in the stack or afield into crazier edge case behavior.  So at some point in questioning (possibly very early), this question exhausts every candidate’s knowledge.  The question is how do they react?  Some candidates start guessing at things.  Some admit they don’t know.  Some try to skirt around areas they don’t feel confident in and work at avoiding any questions where they would have to admit they don’t know something.  And some will actually ask me how part of the system works.  This again is helpful because “not knowing the answer” is such a common experience in real world web dev.  It’s great to have some clues to how a candidate handles that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It gives the candidate an opportunity to show off what they know.</strong>  I’ve gotten some amazing answers to this question.  It turns out some candidates actually know a lot about networking and HTTP/TCP/nameservers.  Some can give detailed answers about browsers and how they parse resources and display the DOM.  Maybe they just know a lot of random trivia about URLs and DNS.  Regardless, this is a chance to show off and prove that they’ve delved deep into something.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be clear, I don’t think every interview question should be like this one.  Most should probably directly relate to the work the candidate is doing, be clearly comparable in an objective way candidate to candidate, and not risk sending the interview down a 10 minute rabbit hole.  But this one is my favorite, and I think there’s a place for questions that show how a candidate might handle some real world lack of structure.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Feel free to hit me up on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben336\">@ben336</a> to tell me your favorite interview question.

That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>\n<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>\n<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>\n<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>\n<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>\n<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>\n<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>\n<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>\n<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.  </li>\n<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>\n<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>\n<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>\n<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> and <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod\">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href=\"https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/\">pre-commit hooks</a>.  </p>\n<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>\n<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>\n<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>\n<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>\n<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/\">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I’ve gotten to work with plenty of non-devs who respect the need for good architecture.
