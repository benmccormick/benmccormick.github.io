{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<div class=\"explanation\">\nMarionette: Explained was a series of posts I wrote in winter 2014-2015 explaining the whats, whys and hows of Marionette, the Backbone Framework.  Marionette is a powerful set of patterns and components built on top of Backbone.js, a minimalist JavaScript MV* framework. It is widely used in the Backbone community, but since most of the resources I found about it were written prior to it's 2.0 version, and the framework had continued to evolve significantly since then, I felt there was a need for a detailed resource on using it.  This was my attempt at creating that resource.  Note that since I published this, Marionette has released a 3rd major version, Marionette 3.  Most of the concepts here still apply, but some specific syntax may be out of date.  \n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/12/02/the-case-for-marionette-js/\">The Case For Marionette.js</a> - A quick overview of what Marionette is and why it’s useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/12/10/marionette-explained-connecting-your-data-to-your-views/\">Connecting Data To Your Views</a> - A look at Marionette’s approach to Views and data-binding</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2014/12/22/building-complex-layouts-with-marionette-js/\">Building Complex Layouts with Marionette.js</a> - A post to explain Marionette’s Regions and layout system, with a focus on complex nested layouts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2015/01/05/marionette-view-life-cycles/\">The Life of a Marionette View</a> - A rundown of the various stages of a Marionette View’s life cycle</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2015/01/26/backbone-radio/\">Building Modular Web Apps with Backbone.Radio</a> - This post examines how to use Backbone.Radio to improve the maintainability of your Marionette projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><a href=\"http://benmccormick.org/2015/03/23/staying-dry-with-marionette-behaviors/\">Staying DRY with Marionette Behaviors</a> - A look at Behaviors and how they help you avoid repetition in your Backbone code.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>I’ve had the opportunity to learn a lot from the Marionette team and community through their <a href=\"https://gitter.im/marionettejs/backbone.marionette\">gitter room</a>. These posts have been much more accurate as a result. I also originally began to understand Marionette after reading <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/building-backbone-plugins?a=3a4Srv2pP9p87WQ_eoDoGp\">Building Backbone Plugins</a> by Derick Bailey, the creator of Marionette. I highly recommend both of those resources to anyone interested in Marionette or Backbone development.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Marionette: Explained","keywords":null,"category":null,"date":null,"path":"/marionette-explained","layout":"page","hideFooter":true},"fields":{"slug":"/marionette-explained"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"marionette-explained-279","internalComponentName":"ComponentMarionetteExplained","path":"/marionette-explained","component":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","context":{"slug":"/marionette-explained","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/404.html","data":{"title":"","path":"/404.html","description":null,"date":null}},{"path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","data":{"title":"A note to recruiters","path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","description":null,"date":"2015-06-04T13:42:18+00:00"}},{"path":"/about","data":{"title":"About Me","path":"/about","description":null,"date":null}}]},"updatedAt":1531055814753,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/benmccormick/benmccormickorg/src/templates/blog-post.js","slug":"/marionette-explained","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/404.html","data":{"title":"","path":"/404.html","description":null,"date":null}},{"path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","data":{"title":"A note to recruiters","path":"/a-note-to-recruiters","description":null,"date":"2015-06-04T13:42:18+00:00"}},{"path":"/about","data":{"title":"About Me","path":"/about","description":null,"date":null}}]}}
