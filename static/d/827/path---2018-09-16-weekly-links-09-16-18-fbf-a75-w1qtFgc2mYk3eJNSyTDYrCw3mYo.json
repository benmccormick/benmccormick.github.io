I’d add that it’s always worth comparing a library to a “do it without the library” approach, to make sure you understand the benefits that you’re getting for your specific project.</p>\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=1f50ce22f02ed0ffc80c10aff&#x26;id=8c0f947e69\">Newsletter | Lara Hogan</a></p>\n<p>I’ve already linked several of <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/\">Lara Hogan’s</a> blog posts in this space, and now she’s started an email newsletter.  Worth checking out.</p>\n<h3>Book Review</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xfflEi\">Ready Player One | Ernest Cline</a></p>\n<p>I’m about 7 years late on this (and even 6 months late for the movie hype), but Ready Player one was a great little sci-fi novel that uses 80’s pop culture as a background for a bunch of insightful commentary about our modern tech culture and where it may be heading.  A lot of fun, and worth reading if you’ve missed it for this long like me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weekly Links: September 16","keywords":"","category":"opinion","date":"2018/09/16","path":"/2018/09/16/weekly-links-09-16-18/","layout":"weekly-links","hideFooter":null,"hideSidebar":null},"fields":{"slug":"/2018/09/16/weekly-links-09-16-18/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/09/16/weekly-links-09-16-18/","relatedPosts":[{"path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","data":{"title":"I hate computing ecosystems","path":"/2012/12/29/i-hate-computing-ecosystems","description":"Why does nothing work together?","date":"2012-12-29T23:06:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","data":{"title":"Medium: The end of History and the last website","path":"/2012/12/25/medium-the-end-of-history-and-the-last-website","description":"Is there any use in personal websites anymore?","date":"2012-12-25T21:00:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}},{"path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","data":{"title":"Bayesian Witch Hunt","path":"/2012/11/09/bayesian-witch-hunt","description":"A nerd tribute from a friend","date":"2012-11-09T12:00:00+00:00","category":"opinion"}}]}}
