            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This fall <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29853800/i-was-wide-open-how-ben-roethlisberger-season-receiver-helped-qb">ESPN published an article</a> about Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger’s high school stint as a Wide Receiver and how it benefited him as he moved forward in his career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before he set records as a quarterback his senior year, before he became the Pittsburgh Steelers’ top draft pick out of Miami (Ohio), and before he won two Super Bowl rings as one of the NFL’s best signal-callers, Roethlisberger spent his junior year of high school playing wide receiver.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It gave Roethlisberger a deeper understanding of the game he took with him the rest of his career — something he found again last season as he stood on the sideline following a season-ending elbow injury in Week 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>”[Findlay] coach [Cliff Hite] was always like, ‘It benefited you as a senior playing quarterback from playing wide receiver your junior year,’” Roethlisberger said. “I never understood it at the time, but I think it does to a certain extent because you can see the other side of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article highlights 2 advantages of the previous receiver experience for Roethlisberger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roethlisberger’s stint as a receiver enables him to be clear with his instructions. Nothing gets lost in translation when the quarterback can give his directives in a way the receiver clearly understands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He can talk our language,” said Ryan Switzer, who played with Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh for two seasons. “He can talk leverage, he can talk technique, he can talk lean and press, he can talk all these things, which makes the communication a lot more fluid between us and him. … He’s able to communicate really well, which helps translate to being on the same page more often on the field.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The carryover from one position to another goes beyond communication. Iriti sees it in the way Roethlisberger eludes the pass rush and finds a receiver on a broken play.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s like he knows where he’s at, and he knows where you’re trying to go, so he can wait until that last second, just make that little move,” Iriti said. “It’s not fast, it’s not quick, but it’s like it’s premeditated that he knows where you’re going. So it makes him seem more agile and quick than he actually is. He’s not a blazing-fast guy, but instinctively he’s really smart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Playing a position that he later had to collaborate with allowed Roethlisberger to communicate with his teammates better and make better adjustments when things went wrong and he needed to understand or anticipate his teammates reactions. </p>
<p>Reading Roethlisberger’s stories reminded me of some of my own practices as a high school basketball player. Our coaches would force us to switch positions around when practicing plays.  The theory was that you didn’t really know a play until you could execute on every position’s part of it.  As a tall but gawky and uncoordinated high schooler, I was never likely to move away from my forward position to become a full time point guard, but the exercise was useful both for the reasons called out above, as well as the flexibility it gave us to play different lineups for shorter stretches during a game.  If we had problems with injuries or foul trouble, we could get away with playing people at a different position for some stretch of time, or play different groupings of players that let us take advantage of matchups.  </p>
<p>So what does any of this have to do with the purported topic of this blog, productive software teams?  It turns out that modern software teams have a lot in common with sports teams.  They’re a collection of individuals with different skillsets who take on different roles to work together towards a set of goals over time.  Our work has less black and white scorekeeping, and the lines between “games” are a lot blurrier, but there is a lot we can learn from the world of sports. </p>
<p>The lessons from my high school basketball days have stuck with me as I’ve progressed through my software career.  I find that I collaborate better with my teammates when I have some sense of what it is like to do their job.  A benefit of spending the last 7 years in startups was the opportunity to wear a lot of different hats on a short term basis.  I’ve always done an mix of front end and backend development. I once was assigned the role of being primary test engineer for a major release while our normal QA lead was taking a few weeks off out of the country.  As my career advanced I got to get more involved with the product management side of things, collaborating closely with PMs to help shape how products got built.  I even spent a memorable and painful couple months as my team’s primary designer after a round of layoffs.  As both an individual contributor and an engineering manager, these experiences have helped me work well with a variety of different people, identify times when teammates in different roles were talking past each other, and plug gaps when the need arose. It also gives me empathy for people who are facing the tough parts of their job, and a level of humility when approaching discussions that comes from knowing there are always many perspectives on a particular problem or process.</p>
<p>Unlike sports, we don’t usually consciously “practice” in software development.  That may be a mistake, but given it is the world we live in, how do we actually develop this type of experience?  I’ve found 3 primary things helpful: doing the work, talking with people experienced in the role, and reading about the role.  This isn’t that different than the learning process if you actually wanted to pursue a particular role, the time commitment is just lower.</p>
<p>If you have the ability to just do a piece of a project in a different role or fill in for someone for a short time, that can be the easiest way to quickly develop some intuition about a role.  For some role combos that’s pretty easy.  A software engineer can always take a shot at doing more of a test engineer role.  Look at another developer’s code and think about how you would test it. You probably won’t be doing what a full time test engineer would do, but just getting into the mindset can be helpful.  It can feel harder to cover other roles - how would you “try out” being an engineering manager as a junior engineer?  But you might be able to ask the person in that role if there’s some part of their job you can help them with.  Then you get to try out a piece of the role and potentially get some guidance to go with it.  </p>
<p>One problem with “just doing it” is that when we first try a new skill or role, we don’t know what we don’t know.  It’s easy to perform a parody of the role if we don’t get any meaningful feedback on our performance.  So it is helpful to talk with somebody who is experienced in the role, ideally an expert.  They can give you feedback on your attempts or just tell you about what they do and how they see the world.  The ability to listen well and ask good questions can take you far here. </p>
<p>Finally, there are a lot of written resources out there for learning about different roles.  To help work with people in a certain role it can help to read some of the “classic” essays or books about a role.  A learning-focused person in the role will be able to make recommendations, but if you don’t have a good resource there you can get a similar effect with careful googling for “best books for product managers” or similar.  Some books I’ve found helpful for understanding different roles include <a href="https://amzn.to/2KVewdZ">Inspired</a> for product managers, <a href="https://amzn.to/3hx6Iee">The Manager’s Path</a> for engineering managers, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3hyC6ca">The Design of Everyday Things</a> for product designers.</p>
<p>For pretty much every piece of career advice out there, there are pathological variations that should be avoided.  Almost everything can be taken too far or stripped of context to the point where it becomes harmful.  I’ve seen at least one common way that the pursuit of understanding our teammates roles can go wrong.  That is simple ego; it can be tempting to believe that because we’ve walked a mile in somebody’s shoes we’re the experts and our voices should now hold heavy weight when making decisions in our teammates area of expertise.  We should always be listening to our teammates and taking in different opinions. However, it is still valuable to have “owners” for a role, and spending a week or a month or even a year working in a role is not the same as making it your career.  There are going to be times where a more experienced team will need to support somebody in their role, especially if they’re new.  But that’s not the same as you “being able to do it better” or “having veto power”.  This can get quite bad; I’ve known engineers who genuinely believed that they could step in and do any role in their company better than the people who had made it their careers.  This is the opposite of the empathy we’re trying to create.</p>
<p>I’m wary about aggrandizing this advice.  Trying other roles is a simple technique for working better with your teammates and it isn’t going to change the world.  But I’m writing this on the first day of 2021.  2020 was a year that was marked by a lot of suffering and struggle across our world, and also one that seemed to me to lead many people away from empathy and connection and toward conflict.  Consider this as a simple way to build empathy and connection with your teammates this year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was the 7th full year of this blog, and it was by far the quietest in terms of output.  For reasons that are both obvious (global pandemic!) and personal (toddler, puppy, still learning a new job) writing has been on the backburner for a year.  I hope to change that in 2021, but with another child on the way in February I’m not foolish enough to make any promises here. </p>
<p>I only published 5 posts this year, with the posts generally focused on what I was reading and learning as an engineering manager.  </p>
<h3>Most Read Post Published in 2020</h3>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage">Simple Burnout Triage</a> - This post got picked up by <a href="https://changelog.com/">The Changelog</a> which led to a pretty large spike — but it also is obviously a topic that a lot of people are working through in 2020.  Given that this got 70x more views than any of my other new posts this year, it can hog the summary spotlight all by itself this year. </p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used a lot of in 2020</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6 + TypeScript), React, Node + Express, lodash, Jest, Redux</p>
<p>But realistically this was my first year spending significantly more time focused on people &#x26; product management than hands on software work</p>
<h3>Tech I want to try in 2021</h3>
<p>My code time is limited these days — but I’d like to go deeper into some of the cool new stuff around React like Server Components, and also learn Terraform.  </p>
<h3>Blogs I started following in 2020</h3>
<p><a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/">The Beautiful Mess by John Cutler</a></p>
<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lethain.com/">Irrational Exuberance! by Will Larson</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://larahogan.me/">Lara Hogan’s Engineering Leadership blog and newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2020</h3>
<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, iMessage, Slack, Jira, 1Password, VS Code, iTerm, Fish Shell, Github, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear -> Roam Research, CloudApp, Dash, Postman, Complice</p>
<h3>Best Technical Books I read in 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/38OqT3l">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> - An information rich exploration of the technologies behind modern “data heavy” information systems.  I learned a lot from this and expect that I’ll be referencing it regularly in the future</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3mX7xyd">Site Reliability Engineering</a> - A set of essays describing how Google maintains their production systems that has served as a template for the SRE role at other companies.  Was an interesting read, even as I’m skeptical of applying “gigantic-corp” strategies at smaller or less technically savvy companies.  With essays like this I always find it more interesting to understand the problems that companies were seeing and how they approached finding a solution than I am with the details of the final solution, and this book does a good job laying that out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Technical Leadership Books I Read in 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3n3xhJb">How To Measure Anything</a> - This was a great read on how to think about measuring things that defy easy measurement.  It starts with a lot of great general principals before going into some more technical / detailed topics in the back half of the book.  Most people could probably benefit from reading at least the opening chapters of this book, with the rest open to skimming based on interests.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/382DK2W">Inspired</a> - This was probably my favorite “work book” I read all year.  It’s aimed at product managers, but was helpful for me as an engineering manager to understand what “great product process” looks like and think through how I can work with PMs well and collaborate on our shared goal of building a great product.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/34Z8ZtD">Making Work Visible</a> - A breezy walkthrough of the principles behind Kanban.  I don’t use Kanban to organize my teams at work, but because of the focus on foundational ideas I still found this bok extremely helpful.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/34ZfBIm">Team Topologies</a> - This is pretty specific and nerdy, but for engineering leaders looking to figure out the best way to evolve teams and split off new ones over time as their companies grow and change, this is a great read.  It argues persuasively for the importance of team structure to productivity and product success.  Highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Non-Technical Books I read in 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3rFWVXQ">Andrew Carnegie</a> - A detailed biography of a fascinating historical figure who defied easy characterization.  Carnegie was an immigrant born in poverty who through hard work and good timing became one of the richest men in the world, a union buster who viewed himself as a “friend of the workers”, a philantropist who wanted to give away his whole fortune, and a political force who aimed for world peace — and protection for his own interests.  It was a great reminder in the sometimes overly black and white world of 2020 that real humans are complicated and don’t fit neatly in our tight political boxes.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Juudbc">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</a> - I’m not the primary cook in my family — I’m blessed to regularly enjoy my wife’s far superior cooking.  But I enjoy it as an occasional activity and this book helped spark even more interest.  Unlike most cookbooks this book is focused on the science and “whys” of cooking rather than procedural formulas for making a particular dish.  It felt empowering and exciting rather than my typical frustration with recipes that didn’t turn out like the images in the cookbook.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3aYB87U">Atomic Habits</a> -  Over the last few years I’ve made a personal transition to focusing more on the habits and routines I’m making part of my life and less on ambitious long term goals.  This book gave me a framework for thinking about that transition as well as practical tips for doing it better.  A quick and helpful read.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hs4lJM">How To Talk So Little Kids Will Listen</a> - An incredibly practical book for how to interact with toddlers.  I’ve found a bunch of helpful parenting books, but none beat this for giving parents practical actionable advice that will reduce stress in your house and help you build a relationship with your kids.  </li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/380fM8k">House of X / Powers of X</a> - For the comics fans out there, I’ve been really enjoying Jonathan Hickman’s run on the X-Men, starting with this graphic novel that soft-reboots the whole world of mutants</li>

            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2020/09/05/how-teams-go-faster</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered John Cutler’s <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/">blog</a>.  Everything I’ve read from him so far is excellent and highly recommended, but this table in particular felt like it was worth sharing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">13/13 Feels like fast ... is actually faster <a href="https://t.co/c87USFeu6b">pic.twitter.com/c87USFeu6b</a></p>&mdash; John Cutler (@johncutlefish) <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1145240762243698688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote> 
<p>It’s amazing to me how unhelpful our intuition often is when we’re under pressure to speed up.  I’ve observed clear examples of several of these items personally over the last several years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I’ve seen my team go significantly faster <em>with less stress</em> by shifting projects to being serialized with pairing and collaboration rather than giving everyone their own project <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve watched attempts to get ahead on planning be thwarted by changing business priorities.  This can be frustrating in the moment until you realize the problem is a planning process that can’t adapt to new information cleanly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve been part of another team that doubled in size and then got cut back in half without much discernable impact in actual output over time.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most effective change my team has made this year has been de-emphasizing filling sprints in favor of being clear about what we’re trying to accomplish in the sprint.  I don’t think we’ve gone far enough in that direction yet.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some items I’d add to John’s list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual QA / Deployments <strong>vs</strong> Test Automation as part of development<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Senior devs filling up on feature work <strong>vs</strong> Senior devs mentoring, enabling and unblocking other devs<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Besides the creative and redundancy benefits of pairing, shared resources like PMs/EMs/QA become bottlenecks as you parallelize.  </p>
<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>This relates to the “handing off” QA point in John’s list.  If the original people responsible for creating the feature aren’t writing automation as part of development, there is likely to be inefficiency or gaps in the testing. </p>
<a href="#fnref-2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-3">
<p>Even worse if this is a manager doing this, something I struggled with as I transitioned from being a <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/25/manager-and-developer">dev-manager hybrid</a> to managing a larger team.  </p>
<a href="#fnref-3" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

            <link>https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage</link>
            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a one question triage process when I’m concerned that I or one of my teammates is headed towards burnout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you take the pace &#x26; quality of the last 2 months of your life and repeated it again and again, how long would you be able to sustain it?   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why 2 months?  It’s long enough to be a representative sample of your pace and cut out the rush of a specific project deadline or medium sized stressful life event<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  But it’s a small enough sample to check in regularly, and most people have a fairly clear sense of what their last 2 months have been like for them and can visualize what repeating it would look like.  </p>
<p>When I ask myself or a teammate this question, it tends to elicit one of 3 responses:</p>
<p><strong>”I can’t go on like this.”</strong>  The current pace is unsustainable and we’re probably already well into the burnout phase where tasks are being dropped, personal needs are not being met, and everyday life has become overwhelming.  </p>
<p><strong>”I can make this work, but…”</strong> The most interesting result of this question to me is that it often makes it clear where a priority is being dropped.  “I’m doing good, but I wish I was doing a better job making time for my kids”.  “I’m getting by, but I feel like I only have time for the urgent and I haven’t had a chance to invest in myself”.   “I can do this for a while longer, but I have to figure out a way to live in the moment in the evenings and leave my work at the office”.  The act of visualizing a plausible future often causes people to hone in on what they’re missing.</p>
<p><strong>”I love my life, and I can keep doing this forever.”</strong>  If this is where you’re at, treasure it and check in regularly to make sure it’s still the case. </p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>The question above is laser focused on triage.  Exactly how to handle partial or complete burnout is situation dependent.  But I try to hold to principles of optimizing for the long term and tying my time to my values.  That means while it sometimes may make sense to live in an unsustainable place for a season, I’m always going to weigh that impact on myself, my family and my teammates against the longterm value and take it seriously<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.  And if my time spent doesn’t line up with my principles and values for a significant length of time, I know it’s time to implement a plan for change.   </p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>For large life changes like job switches, family emergencies, society-changing pandemics etc it is probably better to assume that short term data is not representative, err on the side of scaling back as needed, and take stock of things on a regular basis. </p>
<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>A note on taking things on for a season; It’s only a season if it has a defined endpoint or offramp.  If you and your spouse live in different cities to optimize for your career, or you’re working 70 hour work-weeks because your job demands it, and you don’t know when these things will end, you’re not in a season.  This is your life.</p>

            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/23/better-than-a-guess</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m currently reading Doublas Hubbard’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3lcY3yY">How To Measure Anything</a> and it is driving home a point I’ve observed anecdotally throughout my career; when people don’t know something exactly, they often throw away a ton of things that they do know.  You can see this in project estimation, where engineers often resist providing any estimate since “it’s hard to tell before we actually build it”.  You can see it in product planning, where teams I’ve worked with struggle to provide clear usage or business impact goals since “it is hard to tell how impactful this will be till we build it”.  </p>
<p>Hubbard’s advice for making properly calibrated estimates would probably help in multiple places in the software world:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use 90% confidence intervals when there’s uncertainty, not point estimates or vague categories like “medium risk”</strong> - Saying a piece of software work is “large” is much less actionable and informative than “we’re 90% confident that it will take between 3 and 15 days to complete.  </li>
<li><strong>Use absurd scenarios and alternative bets to calibrate a confidence interval</strong> - You may think you have no idea how long a novel new software project will take, but even for projects with high uncertainty this is untrue.  You can start by asking questions like “is there any chance this will be done tomorrow” and “is there any chance this project will take more than 5 years”.  If the answer is no, then you’ve established a baseline confidence interval, and you can start working inward from there.  When you get to the point that something is feasible if unlikely, its a sign that you’re probably near the 90% confidence interval<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  Once you have a starting place, you can further consider a hypothetical bet where you had to choose between a lottery with a 90% payout of $1000 and a scenario where you got the $1000 when the item ended in your range.  If you would clearly prefer one of those scenarios to the other, your range is probably too tight or too loose.</li>
<li><strong>Model your estimates with simple monte carlo simulations</strong> - Hubbard recommends using Monte Carlo simulations (picking random numbers according to the distributions set up by your confidence intervals ~1000 times) in order to get a better intuition of what real world outcomes might look like.  Doing this right does mean understanding not just the confidence range, but also what the distribution looks like.  Estimating simple software feature work for instance, is likely not a normal distribution.  Many tasks will be straightforward and be completed quickly, but we’ll hit occasional tasks that require significant restructuring of a program to complete.  It’s a classic “long tail” scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Break down estimates into component parts</strong> - One of the most powerful techniques for making better estimates under uncertainty is “Fermi Decomposition”, the process of breaking an estimation problem into smaller estimation problems (which may be more tractable) and then combining the estimate.  In software this can mean breaking up a large project into the component pieces of work and then estimating those.  Doing this right of course means capturing our uncertainty on the sub-estimates, so that we can roll that up into the larger estimate.  If we optimistically point estimate every element of a project, we’re going to end up with a total estimate that is actually less likely, since we need <em>everything</em> to go well to hit that total estimate.  I commonly see engineers handle this by doing optimistic estimates and then adding a buffer period.  It would be better to be clear about uncertainty and do your decompositions with a range of values (although it does make sense to factor in uncertainty about tasks that may be missing).  </li>
<li><strong>Consider what measurements will be valuable</strong> - When we start viewing our estimation goal as reducing uncertainty rather than eliminating it, its easier to see that some easy measurements might go a long way toward improving our projections, even if they won’t take us to an exact value.  For instance if we want to know how many tickets we might close during an upcoming sprint, it can be easy to say that there’s no way to know.  The new work is unique and isn’t necessarily directly comparable to work we’ve done in the past.  However just because we can’t make an exact projection doesn’t mean we know nothing.  If we look at our last 10 sprints and see how many tasks we completed in each of them, we can feel confident that this upcoming sprint is likely to be between the minimum and maximum value in that range, or at least close.  If we’re currently planning like we will accomplish something outside of that range, this could be very useful information.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this definitely has me thinking about the good and bad of software estimation, and how I might incorporate this into my team’s rhythms.  Would love to hear stories of effective estimation processes in software.  What do you do that is better than wild guessing?</p>

<p>Remember that 90% total interval means that there’s a 95% chance that a value is greater than the lower bound and a 95% chance that the value is less than the upper bound.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I don’t read Hacker News much these days, I do subscribe to <a href="https://hackernewsletter.com/">a newsletter</a> that rounds up the best links every week, and there are almost always one or two gems in there. </p>
<p>This week my favorite link was this roundup of <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Essays on Programming I Think About A lot</a> by Ben Kuhn, cataloguing essays on the internet that he comes back to or references repeatedly.  </p>
<p>I’m now ~2 years into managing people and because <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90282088/why-being-a-manager-is-a-career-change-not-a-promotion">Engineering Management is not a promotion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time leading up to that change and since reading about management in an attempt to avoid being completely clueless at my job<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>Like Ben, I have a few key essays and books that I reference and go back to over and over again.  These are a mix of books and essays that have shaped how I think about the job of engineering leadership.  The books here are mostly well known, while the essays are more obscure, and might be a surprising choice to highlight if you asked their authors.  But each one has taught me something specific that has helped shape my leadership style. </p>
<h2>Essays</h2>
<p><a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/leadership-style-colors/">Leadership Style Colors | Lara Hogan</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s totally natural to embody one a lot—that’s your style! But it’s important to be aware of the other styles/approaches available in your leadership toolbox. A strong leader understands that different styles can be valuable when an environment or situation calls for it. As Herminia Ibarra says in my <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox">favorite article</a> on this subject, “Small changes—in the way we carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact—often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup/">Taste The Soup | Rands</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a meeting where an individual or team is presenting a complex idea or project, my job as the leader is soup tasting. It’s sampling critical parts of the idea to get a sense of how this soup has been or will be made. Who are the critical people? What are the critical parts? Which decisions matter? I don’t know. I do believe that a pre-requisite for leadership is that you have experience. You’ve had trials which have resulted in both impressive successes and majestic failures. These aggregate lessons define your metaphoric soup tasting ability, and when your team brings you a topic to review, it is this experience you apply to ask the critical soup questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/">Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder | Charity Majors</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you like engineering management, your tendency is to go “cool, now I’m a manager”, and move from job to job as an engineering manager, managing team after team of engineers.  But this is a trap.  It is not a sound long term plan.  It leads too many people off to a place they never wanted to end up: technically sidelined.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://lethain.com/values-oasis/">Trapped in a Values Oasis | Will Larson</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>  The rule of thumb here is to lead through ambiguity, and advocate through disagreement.
It’s important to diagnose your situation correctly, because when you get it wrong, it’ll still feel like you’re making progress, but it’s wholly dependent on you and it’s progress that is likely to come at the cost of undermining both you and your team within the broader organization. It can be extraordinarily frustrating to “disagree and commit” to a policy or value that goes against your personal values, but any worthwhile measure of successful leadership needs to consider your team’s success more highly than your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/friday-wins">Friday Wins &#x26; A Case Study in Ritual Design | Kellan Elliott-McCrea</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture is what you celebrate. Rituals are the tools you use to shape culture. Yet very few of us think much about ritual design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jyxofc">Radical Candor | Kim Scott</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. You don’t want that person or the rest of the team to think you’re a jerk. Plus, you’ve been told since you learned to talk, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Now all of a sudden it’s your job to say it. You’ve got to undo a lifetime of training. Management is hard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best thing I’ve read on how to give feedback well.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2D4btMb">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hard truth is, bad meetings almost always lead to bad decisions, which is the best recipe for mediocrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of this book is focused on very specific advice for specific types of meetings, but the philosophical takeaway it left me with was much simpler; meetings aren’t non-negotiable things that we all must endure.  They can be designed, and that design matters.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3f4EvbH">The Common Rule | James Early</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All those who want to be attentive to who they are becoming must realize that formation begins with a framework of habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a book written through the lens of the author’s Christian faith, so if that bothers you, you might prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3jInPdF">Deep Work</a>, which covers similar ground in a secular manner.  But for me personally, the rituals and worldview laid out in the Common Rule has been life changing, and has been my most helpful tool as I navigate the “Advanced Time Management 501” lifestyle of engineering management</p>

<p>So how did I get Kusty showing up in the console on this site?  I started with a bit of a cheat: I asciified the logo using <a href="https://www.asciify.me/">asciify.me/</a>.  That got me a nice starting place, I had an Ascii version of Kusty to work with:</p>

<p>At this point I could have tossed that into a console.log and called it a day, but I wanted to take this to the next level.  And that means color!</p>
<p>This isn’t something you run into every day while writing for the web, but it turns out that you can apply css to text in the console using a <code class="language-text">%c</code> macro.  The format goes like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'%cbold text %cred text'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'font-weight:bold'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'color: red'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That code outputs <span style="font-weight: bold">bold text</span> <span style="color:red">red text</span>.</p>
<p>Of course its a pain to split that giant Kusty ascii block into multiple console logs with different colors.  So I minimized the pain and wrote a script that would let me take a set of ranges and render characters in one of 3 colors, and using either solid characters <code class="language-text">A-Za-z1-9+{}&lt;&gt;;</code> or space characters <code> `.,_-’</code>. I did eat the cost of writing out the map characters manually based on the generated ascii.  If I was going to do this again, I’d probably write out a script to generate the map from the original ascii image, and just fill in the color mappings manually. </p>

<p>The code is fairly straightforward, going through each segment and generating a string of random characters based on the map.  The interesting parts are probably:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use <code class="language-text">null</code> to denote new lines.  Could have been anything, but null is pretty obvious when you write out the mapping markup.  </li>
<li>I usually use lodash for this, but I wrote some custom code to pull a random item from an array:
<code class="language-text">const randChar = () =&gt; characters[Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)];</code></li>
<li>I added a rare for loop in JavaScript code: even though map/filter/forEach etc work better for most things, a for loop is still the best way to do things when you’re given a number of times you want something to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>It works pretty well!</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Now that I’ve done this it would be pretty easy to reuse this code to create a terminal Kusty with <a href="https://github.com/chalk/chalk#readme">chalk</a>. Maybe next New Years.</p>

            <link>https://benmccormick.org/2019-roundup</link>
            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2019-roundup</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2019 was the 6th full year of this blog, and it was a bit up and down posting wise.  For the first half of the year I published more or less a post a week, with 24 posts from January till July.  But this is only my 2nd post since then.  </p>
<p>Turns out that starting a new job while learning to be a parent sucks up a lot of time!  I’m not making any promises for 2020, but I expect that my writing rate will fall somewhere in between the first 7 months and last 5 months of 2019.  In the meantime, here’s a brief look back at the year on the blog.</p>
<p>This was my first year where I spent the full year managing people, and that was reflected in the blog’s topics as well as where I spent my time.  </p>
<h3>Most Read Posts Published in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/02/11/reusable-react">Reusable Code In React: Inheritance, Composition, Decorators and Mixins</a> The most popular post for the year was also one of my favorites: a dive into the various mechanisms React provides for reusing code.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/28/readable-async">Improving Code Readability With Async/Await</a> I really like <code class="language-text">async/await</code> but its not always clear how to move older patterns to use it.  This was just a quick example of taking some ugly callback code and converting it to use async await.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/">What’s involved in Front End Architecture?</a>
Another one of my favorite posts to write, this is a look at what types of things developers should be thinking about when they consider front end architecture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used a lot of in 2019</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), React (including hooks), PostgreSQL, lodash, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules, Redux, </p>
<h3>Tech I want to try in 2020</h3>
<p>We’re starting to roll out TypeScript at <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/">Kustomer</a> and I’m excited to use it in production for the first time.  My code time is more limited these days, so that will probably be my main area for learning as I focus more on helping other people get stuff done.</p>
<h3>Blogs I started following in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lethain.com/">Irrational Exuberance! by Will Larson</a> - a great engineering / technical leadership blog</li>
</ul>
<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2019</h3>
<p><a href="https://overreacted.io/">Overreacted by Dan Abramov</a>, <a href="https://larahogan.me/">Lara Hogan’s Engineering Leadership blog and newsletter</a>, <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a> </p>
<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2019</h3>
<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari/Firefox, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, iMessage, Slack, Jira, 1Password, VS Code, iTerm, Fish Shell, Github/Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear, CloudApp, Dash, Postman</p>
<h3>Best Technical Books I read in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/35j1Jq1">The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition</a> - A huge update from the 1st edition, this remains my #1 book recommendation for any professional software developer</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2QhpkTH">Accelerate</a> - A great look at the impact improving devops/release practices can have on software teams/companies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Technical Leadership Books I Read in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management">Resilient Management</a> - A great collection of management wisdom from Lara Hogan.  Nothing revolutionary here for those who already follow her blog/newsletter, but its great to have it all together in one place.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2QyJLKM">The Manager’s Path</a> - A super helpful book for anyone thinking about their career path in tech, especially if they’re considering management.  Lots of helpful tips for those already managing people as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZHbFbx">An Elegant Puzzle</a> - Another “blog book”, this one is a bit of a grab bag of topics, but the content is so high quality it was completely worth it.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Fc4izu">Turn The Ship Around</a> - Not tech-specific, but one of the best books on leadership I’ve read, in the form of a history of a nuclear submarine crew getting ready to deploy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Non-Technical Books I read in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/369CpDX">I Hear You</a> - A small practical book on validation that will make you a better friend / spouse / coworker.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZHuM52">Why We Sleep</a> - A fascinating book on the (pop) science behind sleep</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZH3bRR">Team Of Rivals</a> - A very readable history of the Lincoln presidency focused on his relationships with the other candidates for President in 1860. Incredibly well done.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2MH6F1e">Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</a> - A sobering look at how laws, norms and expectations around rentals and evictions in America contribute to spirals of poverty.  Another very well written book, make sure to read the end to understand the research that went into it and allowed for the very personal feel.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2sFrDqz">The Common Rule</a> - This is a Christian look at how ritual and habit can help us overcome modern distractions and focus on the things that are important.  I’ve read a lot of books in this genre in recent years (Deep Work / Indistractable / The Tech Wise Family) and this was my favorite.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2QyKhsc">The Foundation Trilogy</a> - Classic scifi, and a great read. Fascinating to read a mid 1900s view of the future and realize that while space travel and force fields sounded great, it was inconceivable that casual tobacco use in the home might go away. </li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity this week to walk a software engineer who is new to the field through some lessons I’ve learned over the years about how software engineers add value to the business.  It seemed generally applicable, so here’s a cleaned up version of what I shared.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Is Value?</h2>
<p>It can be easy to think of software engineering work as a series of task where you’re given instructions and you make the computer do what the designer / PM / CEO asked.  Or as a series of fun problem solving challenges that you’re somehow getting paid to complete.  Both of those views will eventually lead you to make suboptimal decisions when it comes to helping your business and growing in your role though.  Instead consider the following definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software Developers create value through shipping working code that solves important user problems in a predictable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This captures a number of important things.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Real Artists Ship - <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software Engineer’s super power compared to other roles is that we get to build.  We create new things, add new behaviors, and ultimately (for a product company) control the shape of the product our company is built around.  This only has value when software actually ships though.  When we’re not shipping, it’s actually worse than just being slow to deliver value, because of a few non-obvious factors.</p>
<p>First, <strong>unshipped code rots.</strong>  When we leave code in a branch 90% done, it doesn’t just stay the same.  It’s quite common for our situation to get worse.  Our teammates check in code that may cause merge conflicts, or worse just doesn’t take into account the unshipped code and sets us up for subtle bugs.  And when we do get back to the work we’ve often lost valuable mental context that makes any remaining work or testing harder and more error-prone.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>we learn from shipping!</strong>  It’s quite common in software development for a developer or team to complete 90% of their feature according to the spec, only to find that they have another 90% of the work to go.  Doing the work to push things through to production inherently de-risks things, because we learn what the challenges are, and we know how long the work took.  Up until then, we will always have unknowns.  And when software goes out to users, we get to hear their feedback as well.  Shipped software lets us learn from our users (and from the performance of our system) and make adjustments that we wouldn’t have known about if we sat on the code.  </p>
<p>So how do we get to shipping?  First, it’s important to push things through to completion rather than allowing ourselves to jump from project to project, making progress without finishing, and incurring a lot of cost from context switching.  Soemtimes this may mean imposing kanban style <a href="https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/">work in progress limits</a> on ourselves.  Second, its often helpful to break things into smaller chunks.  Small code reviews are easier to complete, test, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/22/better-code-feedback">review</a> and verify.  So multiple small changes will often go through faster than the same changes bundled together into a big chunk.  This can go too far, but as long as your changes work in isolation and provide value, I’d encourage erring on this side when in doubt.</p>
<h3>Working Code</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[We Prefer] working software over comprehensive documentation - <em>The Agile Manifesto</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software engineers are responsible for their code working.  At the simplest level that means delivering code that doesn’t crash when run in the intended way.  As we grow and mature as developers however, we should aspire to  learn to write code that will scale to any reasonable load the system might see (and maybe even to unreasonable loads), code that handles odd input or context gracefully, and code that is easy to modify and maintain.  We should also take responsibility for proving that it works; writing tests, making the code easy to monitor in production, and providing good logging for debugging all fall under a software engineer’s domain. We also should make sure that our definition of working matches what the business needs, not just a pedantic reading of whatever spec we’re working off of.  More on that in a moment.</p>
<h3>Solving Important User Problems</h3>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just really funny- What the Customer Wanted expanded <a href="https://t.co/kdr7HKTSDy">pic.twitter.com/kdr7HKTSDy</a></p>&mdash; Frank Spillers (@farreaching) <a href="https://twitter.com/farreaching/status/764256002053025792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Software Engineers can be quite inventive in the ways they write code without solving important user problems.  Some common routes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Working on their own pet projects over the prioritized business problems</strong> - Tech improvement work and engineer-driven projects are part of a healthy organization, but if they consistently replace work that was scoped based on user requests / feedback, they can cause problems</li>
<li><strong>Matching the spec without solving the original problem</strong> - This is partially a design/product problem, but its often possible to meet all the stated requirements for a project without solving the original user pain point.  Great engineers understand exactly what problem they’re trying to solve with a feature and will always step back to evaluate whether they’re succeeding throughout the development process.</li>
<li><strong>Matching the spec and causing new problems</strong> - Oftentimes our efforts to fix cause or expose new problems.  When we dodge responsibility by ignoring or hiding those problems instead of openly evaluating tradeoffs or working to improve the solution, we’re not providing all the value we’re capable of. </li>
</ol>
<p>These are ultimately issues of ownership. When we’re invested in our work, we will want to work on useful problems and make sure they produce real value.  If you’re consistently not feeling that way, it may be time to find something else to work on.</p>
<h3>In a predictable manner</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources - <em>Fred Brooks</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, now we come to the section that is the <em>boring part</em> for many software engineers.  But as somebody who has recently converted to the management side of the fence, the ability to ship predictably is incredibly important.  </p>
<p>It’s important for software engineers to ship predictably in 2 senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is ongoing understanding of when something is likely to ship among the people who need to know</li>
<li>There is ongoing understanding of how something will work when it will ship among the people who need to know.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Estimating software engineering projects is not an exact science. Nobody reasonable expects estimation perfection from software engineers, especially those new to the field.  Instead we aim to be as accurate as possible, and especially to be transparent as those estimates change over time.  </p>
<p>When we encounter obstacles, it’s important to be realistic about what they mean to schedules and update the important people in a timely manner. </p>
<p>For those working on a product team that may be a manager and a PM, for those building something solo, that may be the customers or internal users of the software directly.  It’s never fun to say something is going to be late, but its always better to say that we’ll miss a date that is 2 weeks away than to tell somebody for the first time that you’ve missed the date that was 2 days ago.</p>
<p>Communicating about the scope of work is just as important as schedule.  If we find out a piece of a feature is unfeasable or we dropped it due to time pressure, its important to communicate that.  Depending on your team/product, that may mean sharing with people directly, updating documentation, or just making the new behavior clear in an interface.   </p>
<h3>It’s a process</h3>
<p>Nobody starts out their first software engineering job with a fully evolved sense of how to estimate, scope and document their work.  Most have no clue how to think about building a system to be scalable or when to escalate problems to other members of the team.  These are skills learned through hard experience.  Make sure to <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/05/18/obvious-things">always be reflecting</a> on what you’re experiencing though.  Experience combined with reflection is a powerful mixture, and eventually will lead to growth.  Good luck!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management">Resilient Management</a> by Lara Hogan is a short and useful read for engineering managers who want to think more systematically about how they support their team.  Lara covers concepts like how to connect with a new team, how to encourage growth in your teammates, and how to communicate difficult news.  This is a <em>blog+</em> book: most of the material here has appeared previously in Lara’s blog or newsletter, but for the book it has been cleaned up and organized together in a coherent fashion that makes it greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>If you’ve followed my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/subscribe">newsletter</a> for a while, you’ll have seen me link to Lara’s work on a regular basis.  Lara’s strength as a teacher is building meaningful exercises for thinking through abstract topics, and that plays out here.  Almost every piece of advice and insight comes with a suggestion on how to start implementing it, or an exercise to help you think deeper about yourself or your situation.  I’ve found her <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/leadership-style-colors/">leadership colors</a> and her <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/team-introspection/">MadLibs worksheet for leadership philosophy</a> particularly helpful for me.</p>
<p>In addition to the helpful exercises, the highlights of the book for me were Lara’s look at the BICEPS model for understanding people’s needs at work, the way she structured her book around a groups evolution over time, and the chapter on communication plans.  I’ve made notes to reference each of those areas the next time I hit a relevant situation.</p>
<p>Overall I’d recommend this book to pretty much any early-career engineering manager.  If you’re not already familiar with Lara’s work, there should be some fantastic new ideas for you in here.  If you have followed it, I recommend buying out of appreciation, and to get the concepts bundled in a nice cleanly organized packages.  These are ideas worth paying for.</p>
