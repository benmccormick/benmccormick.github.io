            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/">The Brutal Lifecycle of JavaScript Frameworks | Stack Overflow Blog</a> - This was an interesting analysis on how JavaScript frameworks have risen and fallen.  Among the reasons that it’s interesting is that the data appears to be a bit of a Rorschach test.  The post itself is very negative about the pace of change in the JavaScript framework world.  But I saw a lot of twitter takes like this one:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This “new framework every 6-months” FUD is comical. The crux is centered on 4 JS frameworks released over the last decade. <br><br>4. In 10 years. <br><br>It’s great for my business, but makes me chuckle. <br><br>It’s not really moving that fast y’all. <a href="https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V">https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V</a></p>&mdash; Joel ⛈ (@jhooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/951924735654244352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>Personally I lean more toward the side that there’s nothing wrong here.  The change in frameworks has come during a large change in use cases and technology used on the web.  Think PWAs verse server-side generated sites, and the large amount of new browser APIs and JavaScript language features.  These things have naturally brought new best practices which have been encoded in frameworks.  While it is true that a jQuery based site from 2009 might be difficult to maintain through today, that has less to do with the lack of support for the technology than it does with the fundamental nature of web development.  It would be much more difficult to build and scale a web application like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> using only jQuery and other 2009 technologies.<br>
Which is why it was surpassed for <em>web application</em> development first by a wave of frameworks that allowed you to model domain concepts in an object oriented way and tie that to a UI (Backbone, Angular1, Knockout), and then by a second wave that allowed you to do that with more declarative component-based UIs (React, Ember, Angular2+, Vue).  Those evolutions have come to match a real need.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48270127/can-a-1-a-2-a-3-ever-evaluate-to-true/48274520#48274520">Can (a ==1 &#x26;&#x26; a== 2 &#x26;&#x26; a==3) ever evaluate to true? | Stack Overflow</a> - This was a fun little question.  I don’t think I like it as an interview question for JavaScript, since it borders on trivia, and requires in-depth knowledge of the “bad parts” of JavaScript like <code>==</code> and <code>with</code> or global variable behavior that many new developers are just taught to avoid.  But it’s definitely a fun trivia question.  And it may even be a good interview question in Python, where you can do it using more commonly accepted parts of the language.</p>

I’m not going to try to give anyone investment advise, but it seems clear for now that at minimum these “currencies” are completely unusable for their theoretical purpose as currency given the price swings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/09/mobx-first-impressions/">wrote about Mobx last year</a> and am still enjoying using it a year later.  I’m excited to dive into Mobx-state-tree and hopefully sharpen my Mobx skills in the process.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools And Practices</h3>

I’m glad to see how organized they are on this.  It’s really hard to take something that was built with a slower architecture fast while it’s being used by tens of thousands of people every day.  They’re making great progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2DqBeSQ">Clean Architecture | Robert C Martin</a> - I’ll probably be posting more on this soon, but I’ve been reading the new book on architecture by “Uncle Bob” Martin, and it’s fantastic.  It breaks down big architecture and program design concepts like the Single Responsibility Principle and Dependency Inversion, and explains them well individually, but also shows how they fit together when designing a large system.  I’ll write a full review when I finish the book, but for now just wanted to share that it is worth picking up.</p>

            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year I’ve been acting as the lone JavaScript resource working on a codebase with around 90k lines of JavaScript code.  That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>
<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>
<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>
<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>
<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>
<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>
<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>
<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>
<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>
<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.  </li>
<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>
<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>
<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>
<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>
<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> and <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/">pre-commit hooks</a>.  </p>
<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>
<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>
<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>
<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>
<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>

Use bookmarks, type in URLs directly, basically go to sites directly for content instead of relying on social media algorithms to find stuff for you.  I think this is easier said than done.  Social networking sites are ingrained into our culture at this point. You don’t replace culture by condemning it, and telling everyone to go without but by creating something new or better<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.  So what can we make as Internet users that provides something as easy or easier than the mindless serendipity of social media, but produces better outcomes?  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 was the 5th full year of this blog, and in many ways it was the most productive.  I wrote one of the most popular things I’ve written on here, started the weekly links section (on hiatus for New Years, but will return next week), and wrote 21 full articles and 8 weekly links post, the most I’ve ever posted here in a year.  Here are some of the highlights from my blog and development this year.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I think there’s a hunger out there for clearer roadmaps for folks who are early out in their front end development career.  People are telling them to learn all the frameworks, all the tools and all the compile-to-JS languages, and everyone knows they can’t learn it all.  So even an imperfect list that can serve as a starting point for figuring that out can get some traction.  This article was my attempt to answer “what should a serious mid-level JavaScript developer have learned and be learning?“.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">How To Follow The JavaScript Roadmap</a> - This post was aimed at a similar audience to the “Serious JavaScript Developer” post, but aimed to help folks who want to follow changes in the JavaScript language keep up with new developments.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/03/orthogonality-and-css-in-js/">Orthogonality and CSS in JS</a> - This article was an examination of the architecture tradeoffs of CSS in JS solutions, and also an examination of how people discuss “separations of concerns” in general.  If you liked this one, keep your eyes open.  I’m planning on writing more architecture level posts in 2018.</p>

<h3>Code I wrote in 2017</h3>
<p>Most of the code I wrote this year was again for my work at Windsor Circle.  But I’ve continued to add new features to this blog, which is based on React and Gatsby, and the source code for that is available <a href="https://github.com/benmccormick/benmccormickorg">on Github</a>.</p>
<h3>Talks I gave in 2017</h3>
<p>This was a big speaking year for me.  I gave 3 different talks: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/vim-survival-guide-71763917">The Vim Survival Guide</a> at Open Source 101, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro">Intro to Gatsby</a> at a local meetup group and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/saving-time-by-testing-with-jest">Saving Time with Jest</a> at All Things Open.  I’d be interested in giving any of those talks again next year, so if you’re looking for a speaker, feel free to reach out.</p>
<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">Mobx</a> is a JavaScript data modeling library that serves as an alternative to Redux or React state for state management.  I wrote about my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/09/mobx-first-impressions/">first impressions</a> at the beginning of the year, but I’ve continued to use it and love it since then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a> was a nice upgrade over npm.  My understanding is that npm has since stepped up and closed the gap here, but I’m continuing to use Yarn for now since it has taken over my projects and muscle memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I upgraded this blog to Gatsby 1.0, I had the opportunity to learn about <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>.  I’ve really enjoyed getting to play with it and love the GraphQL community’s dedication to providing a great developer experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, Backbone (<strong>sigh</strong>), lodash, MobX, Jest</p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2018</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory">Victory</a>, Rust, and Pandas/other python data analysis libraries <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Blogs I started following in 2017</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/">Mark Erikson’s Dev blog</a></p>
<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2017</h3>
<p><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://purposedworking.org/">purposedworking.org</a>, <a href="https://wynnnetherland.com/">wynnnetherland.com</a></p>
<h3>Podcasts I started listening to in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/">Planet Money</a> - A long running NPR podcast about money, the economy, and the unexpected ways they affect our everyday lives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theallusionist.org/">The Allusionist</a> - A great podcast on the crazy history behind different words in the English language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> - I mentioned I was testing this out at the end of last year, but it has become my go-to notes application, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a stylish notes app in the middle ground between Apple Notes and Evernote (and who uses Apple products).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari/Firefox, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, Instapaper, iMessage, Slack, Trello, 1Password, Atom/Vim, iTerm, Fish Shell, Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear, Annotate, Dash</p>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>Yes this is basically the same list as last year.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mostly learn tech as I have need for it, and it was a very “nose to the grindstone” year focused on improving existing codebases this year</p>

<p><a href="http://raganwald.com/2017/12/14/73939133.html">73,939,133 / Truncatable Primes | Reg Braithwaite</a> - A nice writeup about how brute force can be useful in solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> style math problem.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/12/18/jest-22.html">Jest 22: Refinements &#x26; Custom Runners | Jest Blog</a> - This looks like a solid refinement release for Jest.  One warning: If you’re running <code>jest -o</code> on precommit hooks as I described <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/">here</a>, Jest 22 fails when run with 0 tests, so you need to specify the <code>--passWithNoTests</code> flag in order to let things go when you make a change that doesn’t affect any tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-12-20-introducing-the-gatsby-ux-research-program/">Introducing The Gatsby UX Research Program | Gatsby Blog</a> - An unusual case of doing real UX research for an open source developer tool.  Very cool stuff.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat">Google Maps’s Moat</a> - If you have any interest in product design, maps, or computer intelligence, this is the one article you need to read this week.  Beautifully put together.  It’s an in depth examination of the difference between Google and Apple maps, but it reads as a deeper exploration of how big data combined with computer learning and automation can have a huge impact on product design.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://stateofjs.com/">The State Of JavaScript 2017</a> - This annual survey of JavaScript developers always has lots of interesting insights.  Since it is an internet survey, I view it less as a full snapshot of the industry, but more as a place to see what is new and trending in the JS world.  This year <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> caught my eye as spiking in popularity.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/12/the-glimmer-binary-experience">The Glimmer Binary Experience | LinkedIn Engineering</a> - I had the privilege of seeing Yehuda Katz, one of the Ember core developers, give a talk about <a href="https://glimmerjs.com/">Glimmer</a> and bytecode at this year’s All Things Open conference.  They’re doing some pretty serious software engineering in the Ember community right now.  This write-up covers a lot of the same ground and is worth a read.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/12/12/atom-1-23.html">Atom 1.23</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_19">Visual Studio Code 1.19</a> were released this week, making this a big week for Electron based text editors.  If you use either of them, you’ll get to enjoy a nice set of performance improvements when you upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.bear-writer.com/bear-1-4-the-tags-edition-298d6fdc55dd">Bear 1.4</a> - Speaking of software that I love to use getting updates, I’ve been using Bear as my primary notes app for the last year, and it is a delight.  Getting autocomplete on tags this week solved it’s last real annoyance for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a simple notes app.  It’s more powerful than Apple’s notes or text files, but cleaner and more elegant than <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.  And even the paid level is very affordable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/07/introducing-the-react-rfc-process.html">Introducing the React RFC Process | React Blog</a> - React is now using a public process for proposing and designing new features, starting with a new context API.</p>

The named exports are pretty much always better than the default ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns">Advanced React Component Patterns | Egghead.io/Kent C. Dobbs</a> - This is a new Egghead course on React Component patterns, and is the best “advanced” React resource I’ve seen.  If you’re a React developer, you should either watch it this weekend while it is still free, or pay up to Egghead (it will be behind their subscriber wall starting Monday).  He also released a <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs">beginner level React course</a> this week that will remain free.</p>

I’ve switched back to Firefox over the past 2 weeks and am pretty happy with it so far.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-appsync/">Introducing AWS AppSync | AWS News Blog</a> - AWS announced a bunch of new services this week, but I wanted to highlight AppSync, an Amazon GraphQL service.  <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> seems to be gaining more and more momentum, and if you don’t know anything about it I’d suggest checking it out.  I’ve gotten to play with it since rewriting my blog to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> 1.0, and it is a nice way to work with data.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/this-city-hall-brought-to-you-by-amazon/">This City Hall, brought to you by Amazon | The Seattle Times</a> - I’m amazed by the incentives cities have been willing to offer Amazon to locate a headquarters in their city.  I think the outrage in this column is a bit over the top, but it is a startling insight into the power large tech companies have over the cities where they’re located.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2i78Knm">Doomsday Clock - #1</a> - If you have any interest in comic books DC’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2i78Knm">Watchmen</a> sequel has begun.  It’s a story that crosses over with the mainstream DC Universe, and appears to be a rebuttal of the cynical vantage point of the original work.  This is the first of 12 issues over the next year and it was a strong (but slow start).  If you’re interested in Watchmen but don’t read a lot of comics, this is the continuation of a story that began with <a href="http://amzn.to/2jD0Y5c">a big DC special</a> and continued in a special <a href="http://amzn.to/2i5zSDn">Batman/Flash crossover</a></p>
