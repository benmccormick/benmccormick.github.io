            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working with people over the internet is different from meeting in an office five days a week.  This isn’t a moral statement.  I’ve done and enjoyed both.  Working with a distributed team requires a different set of skills, especially when you’re a leader.  Today I want to share the most helpful lessons I’ve learned over the last year managing a distributed team.</p>
<h4>Evaluate process and outcomes, not inputs</h4>
<p>Focusing on output` is great advice for any team, but it’s easier and more important when managing remote teams.  When you’re not in the office with people, you won’t see when they start in the morning or finish at night.  You won’t be able to tell if they’re taking long coffee breaks or checking Amazon between tasks.  You’ll have to evaluate them on their output and on the methods they use to get work done.</p>
<p>Evaluating on outputs is tricky for tech work in the short term.  It’s often hard to tell how hard a specific task should have been.  But over the long run, you’ll need to find ways to see if developers are meeting their goals, and focus on that over the exact times they did work.  And this is good, because that is actually what matters.</p>
<p>Output is a lagging indicator though.  In the short term, what you can evaluate if “butts in seats” isn’t an option.  I recommend process: is work being documented, are tests being written and are code reviews being done in a timely manner?  The nice thing about this is that you can check these things in low touch ways; by reviewing your issue tracking and version control systems rather than having status meetings or sending distracting slack messages.  This idea comes up in <a href="https://amzn.to/2XBg1iv">Camille Fournier’s book The Manager’s Path</a>, where she argues persuasively for always doing your information gathering in ways that don’t disrupt your team first.</p>
<h4>1-1s are extra important</h4>
<p>Let’s say Sarah has some lingering concerns about her current project that she’s not yet ready to raise to the full group.  When I work in the same office with Sarah, she can drop by my desk anytime to talk through a small issue.  When we’re working remotely, that may not feel as comfortable for a variety of reasons.  Good 1-1s provide space for the little things to come out.</p>
<h4>When you get in-person time, focus on the relationship</h4>
<p>Currently I get together with my team (and my manager) about once a quarter.  Initially my instinct was to save the “big work stuff” for that time.  And I still try to get a few big conversations in each time, mostly around career development.  But the most value from these visits has come in the gaps, when I go out to lunch with my team and chat, or we get together with a larger group after work.  Time spent together builds trust, and that trust lingers and pays off when you’re back on the other side of the internet the next week.</p>
<h4>Async communication is great.  Don’t neglect “face to face” time.</h4>
<p>“Embrace async communication” is common remote work advice.  When you get stuff done through email/slack/Github/Invision/etc you have fewer meetings and more flow time for your team.  Which is great!  My team takes advantage of “async” tools every day.  But I also try to be intentional about working in “face to face” time through Zoom.  For my team that’s a daily standup and weekly 1-1s, but it could be different for another team’s process.  The key is to not <em>only</em> rely on writing.  Writing is an amazing way to communicate, but it will always lack the context of the human face.  For now I’m aiming for a mix of mostly async with regular “internet face to face”, and occasional “in person”.</p>
<p>Make sure to personalize your communication as well.  If Jerry tends to miss all nuance when you communicate in text, try to spend more time talking over zoom to make sure you’re communicating.  On the other hand if Jennifer has a tendency to lose track of what you’re asking her to do, you may want to give instructions through a text medium, where you can use it for accountability later.</p>
<h4>Hire for remote success</h4>
<p>Not everyone is going to thrive in a remote role.  Most companies hiring remote recognize this and try to filter for it in some form. A lot of companies’ response here is to “only hire senior”.  Which is probably a workable heuristic in some ways.  Developers that have a proven track record of success probably have built up some habits that will help them succeed in remote work even if they aren’t naturally inclined to it.  But hiring only senior folks is expensive, and makes things like diversity and career growth paths harder.</p>
<p>I haven’t done this enough to draw any hard conclusions on remote hiring yet.  But the qualities I want to evaluate for are independence, technological comfort, writing skills, and a history of taking the initiative to seize opportunities (in whatever domain).  Obviously that’s in addition to normal hiring criteria.</p>
<h4>Tools and Process matter</h4>
<p>The worst way to work remote is to not commit to it.  Commitment means aligning your process toward remote work.  Some lessons here.</p>
<p><strong>First, Hybrid meetings are harmful to your team</strong>.  There are 3 ways to do meetings: in person, remote, or hybrid.  An in person meeting involves putting a number of humans in a small room for an hour and letting them talk through an issue.  A remote meeting connects various people from the comforts of whatever work venue they’ve chosen, and discussion ensues over the internet.  In a hybrid meeting, some people are in the room, and some are connecting remotely.  Hybrid meetings are hell for the remote folks.  Usually they can’t hear at least one person well.  They can’t match faces to voices, lose context of what is happening in the room, and are sometimes just plain ignored by the folks in the room.</p>
<p>I really didn’t understand how bad this was until I did it myself a few times.  If you’re a leader who uses or tolerates hybrid meetings, I highly recommend trying to call into them remotely a few times.  As the boss you’ll get a slightly different experience, but ask yourself: are you a first class meeting participant when you’re calling in remote?  If not, is it acceptable to you to treat your remote workers as second class participants?</p>
<p><strong>Second, Use good tools</strong>.  Bad collaboration software is a drag if you’re working with people in person.  It’s a killer for remote teams.  Use software that lets you communicate in timely and useful ways, keep your project critical information organized, and lets your team focus on getting stuff done.  There are hundreds of good tools out there these days, so there’s no excuse for using bad ones.  My recommendations, which are not particularly controversial and also not the only good options: use Zoom for video chat, Slack for messaging, Bitbucket, GitHub, or Gitlab for Version Control, Trello or Jira<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> for task tracking depending on the size of your team, and Google Drive for keeping documents and documentation together<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My team doesn’t actually use Google Docs for documentation, we use Confluence.  Which is… worse than Jira.  So this is more of a “don’t be miserable like me” recommendation than one based on experience.  I’d be curious to hear if anyone has a documentation/wiki tool that they love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Titles in the software engineering world are strange.  Without much work, it’s easy to find <em>Senior Engineers</em> with 2 years of professional experience, <em>junior developer</em> job descriptions requesting 5 years of experience, <em>tech lead</em> roles focused purely on technology, <em>tech lead</em> roles where the lead is managing a team, and who can tell the difference between a <em>CTO</em> and a <em>VP of Engineering</em> anyway?  This results in weird title shifts when developers switch jobs, odd or unfair salary distributions, and a world where it is very difficult to understand what a career path looks like in this industry.</p>
<p>Camille Fournier’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p">The Manager’s Path</a> steps into this breach by laying out a clear look at an engineering management-focused career path. The book runs through a series of roles: <em>Mentor</em> to <em>Tech Lead</em> to <em>Manager</em> to <em>Manager of Managers</em> all the way up to <em>Executive</em>. For each role she describes what the job is,  walks through what type of challenges you might face in the role after a promotion, and offers practical advice on overcoming those challenges.</p>
<p>I found it to be an extremely engaging read, and the best description of what it actually looks like to advance in technical leadership roles I’ve ever read.  Because she focuses on skills and responsibilities more than titles, it’s possible to apply her advice across large and small companies, even those with wonky title structures.  It helped me think about what skills I need to be building in my career, and gave me a glimpse of what next steps look like.</p>
<p>The focus on common challenges and how to face them was also helpful, though whole books could (and have) been written on those challenges and how to face them at each level.  The Manager’s Path serves as a good starting point here, identifying the challenges and giving good solid general advice for facing them.  For those new to a role it could help them identify where they’re weak or uncomfortable, and serve as a starting point to a deeper dive into those areas.</p>
<p>As I read the book, I immediately thought of 4 or 5 people at various points in their career I knew who could benefit greatly from reading this book.  If you’re working in the software world and think that you long term are interested in advancing in your career beyond your current role, there will probably be interesting tidbits in here for you.  Even those who are sure they <strong>don’t</strong> want to be in management could benefit from understanding the perspectives of what engineering managers actually <em>do</em>.  The book is also structured so that the first few chapters are highly relevant for both technical and manager track developers; tech lead is an important role on both tracks.  If you fall into one of those buckets, I highly recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2F2jG1p">The Manager’s Path</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a way to help myself grow in my first year as a manager, I’ve been working through <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-develop-and-support-managers/steps/review-googles-new-manager-training/">Google’s New Manager Training</a> which they have generously published online.  One exercise that stood out to me was a “values selection” process, where they encourage managers to select a ranked list of 5-10 words that resonate with them as values from a list of around 400 “values words”.</p>

<p>Choosing values is an odd process, because you’re choosing between “goods”.  When I first went through this sheet, I circled over 40 words as values that “resonated” with me.  They’re things that I value and strive for, or wish that I was more like.  Deciding between adventurousness and cowardice is not a “values decision”. A real values decision means that you’re trying to decide whether good traits like adventurousness, belonging, or clear-mindedness are more important to you.</p>
<p>Management often forces you to choose between goods: Will we ship quicker? Aim for higher quality? How do those choices impact work/life balance for our teams?. It’s hard to know if we’re making good choices, because the results routinely lack clarity.  Indicators lag, causation is fuzzy, and we don’t get to compare to a control group.  Values can be guideposts through ambiguity.  I’ve seen the power of this at a company level in my current gig, where having a set of values that are kept in the spotlight often allows us to weaponize them as decision making tools <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Going through the list, I eventually cut things down to 20, 12, 10 and then 8.  That still feels like a lot to me, but for each of the 8 I can easily cite work situations I’ve faced in the past month where my response came directly out that value.  In the end I ended up with <em>Integrity</em>, <em>Thankfulness</em>, <em>Community</em>, <em>Prudence</em> (in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence">classical sense</a>), <em>Generosity</em>, <em>Continual Improvement</em>, <em>Accountability</em>, <em>Justice</em>.  I find that these are easy to connect to my everyday work when I write them out as more detailed sentences though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Act with <em>integrity</em>.</li>
<li>Live with <em>thankfulness</em> for what I’ve been blessed with.</li>
<li>I want to work and live life in <em>community</em>.</li>
<li>Make decisions based on a rational analysis of reality, not feelings and first impressions (<em>Prudence</em>).</li>
<li>Don’t save it all for myself. Leave margin and be <em>generous</em>.</li>
<li><em>Continual Improvement</em> + Goodism are a powerful combo<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Be <em>accountable</em> for my responsibilities and hold others to the same.</li>
<li>Actively work for <em>justice</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve published them <a href="/my-values">here</a> with a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Those are “guideposts” that I can easily quote to myself or post up somewhere, but they still have enough substance to say something meaningful when I’m considering how to handle a low-performing employee, organizational changes, or personal career decisions. I’ve already seen these values bring a clarity to my thinking about tough things in a short period of time.  If you’re interested, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-develop-and-support-managers/steps/review-googles-new-manager-training/">Google’s training</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen how quickly this becomes useless when those values are not universally embraced or enforced.</p>

<p>Probably a separate post, but <em>goodism</em> has always been my response when asked if I’m a perfectionist: “I’m a goodist.  I care about doing work that is good and meets the needed standards, but tend to move to the next challenge when I pass that bar and hit diminishing returns”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to find myself using the term “herding cats” a lot when confronting inertia, disorganization or ambiguity in work situations.  <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=herding%20cats">Urban Dictionary</a> actually endorses this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase herding cats comes from the common saying that something involving coordination of many different groups or people is as difficult as herding cats. One of the commonly encountered uses of the term in technical fields is the phrase “Managing programmers is like herding cats” or “Managing engineers is like herding cats”. In education it would be “Managing students is like herding cats”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase correctly captures the difficulty of getting a group of programmers (or even worse <em>teams of programmers</em>) on the same page.  But there’s an inherent arrogance to it.  The implication is that the herder is the adult in the room and everyone else’s pointless individualism is getting in the way.</p>
<p>There are days that I think I could fix everything if I could just get the *&#x26;$% cats to move in the right direction.  In those situations  I’ve started telling myself that what I’m actually doing is herding <strong>lions</strong>.  How do you herd a group of lions?  I have no idea.  But I know that if you don’t start with a healthy respect for the lion’s capabilities and agenda, it won’t end well for you.</p>
<p>When you treat people like lions, it’s an opportunity to stop and figure out <em>why</em> they’re not just getting on board with your <em>obvious</em> plan.  It’s an opportunity to learn, to find new ways to motivate people, and maybe even to empower somebody who had been viewing themselves as more of a kitten.  Ultimately the best teams flourish where people can <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/">be strong contributors, take risks and do work they find meaningful</a>.  They’re teams of lions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw a tweet thread a few weeks ago that made me think:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s a bit of a meme in some parts that there is value in saying, out loud, “I realize that I am surprised.” For similar reasons, I often subvocalize “I believe I now understand the type of situation the ‘trivial’ advice was preparing me for.” <a href="https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH">https://t.co/JzdYmSvJWH</a></p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115751939210223616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And then you repeat it to someone and they say “lol that is obvious” and you wonder if you know the advice well enough yet to correct them on how not obvious it is going to be for their next 10 years.</p>&mdash; Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1115752453910061056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2019</a></blockquote>
<p>I realized that I’ve encountered plenty of pieces of wisdom in my software career that have this property; I see them as clear and obvious when put in the abstract, but only learn to actually apply them by repeatedly failing to do so.  This is what people talk about when they say something is “hard earned experience” I guess.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from my career:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In the long run, rate of improvement (or regression) matters more than current level</strong> - This has applications in hiring, code quality, and finding/staying in a job.  But it’s often easier to observe how good something is now than to see how its changing, and I often fail to properly estimate what a trend means for a situation 1-3 years down the road.  It’s also easy to mis-apply this principle when you for get about the “long run” part.  A new employee with tons of potential won’t help you when you need an experienced hand <em>now</em> and fixing technical debt can easily cost you your ability to hit a quarterly objective.  Knowing how to balance these long and short term goals is something I still struggle with all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Rewriting from scratch is (almost) never worth it</strong> - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Joel Spoelsky</a> wrote about this way back in 2000 and I remember reading that article nearly a decade ago and nodding along.  I seem to have infinite capacity to convince myself that my current situation fits in those parentheses though.  In my career this has mostly been a problem where I’m able to more accurately forecast the pain that would ensue from fixing what exists (because that code exists and is easier to work with), while I appear to systematically underestimate the pain of building the new thing (because the internet told me it would be great, and the code doesn’t exist for me to nitpick yet).</li>
<li><strong>Always consider multiple options</strong> - Pretty much any decision (technical or otherwise) benefits from having multiple contenders.  This seems obvious.  But I have often let myself fall into situations where I’m choosing between just 2 options, or really just choosing whether or not to do 1 thing.  This has applications in technology choices, job choices, responding to another person’s provocations, and more.  I intuitively know that more options are good, and I constantly miss opportunities to add options.</li>
</ol>
<p>So how do we improve on these situations where we fail to apply <em>obvious</em> wisdom?  I’ve been learning a few things lately.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always review what you’ve done on a regular basis</strong> - Do weekly reviews about how your week went.  Do quarterly reviews with yourself about how your job is going.  When you make big decisions, make sure to find a time to check back in later and evaluate how it went.  We make better decisions when we take the time to measure our results</li>
<li><strong>Note Missed Opportunities</strong> - When you do those reviews, make sure to pay attention to when you missed an opportunity to apply something you <em>knew</em>.  Sometimes we make mistakes because we just didn’t know something.  It’s more common though that we didn’t properly apply our own principles and knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Cues</strong> - Identify the thing that you know you’re going to have to handle different next time.  Maybe you say “if I’m looking for a job, I should consider at least 4 or 5 different companies and not focus in on just one”, or if I’m asked to fix a legacy codebase, I will spend at least 3 months trying to improve it before considering a re-write,and I’ll look for real world comparisons to base a rewrite estimate on”.  Whatever it is for you, when you can identify situations where a specific action should take place, it can help you be better the next time instead of repeating the same old mistakes.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Deliberate practice [is when] (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve […] (2) <strong>you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it is most productive.</strong></p>
<p><em>- Cal Newport, Deep Work</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2TqwDeR">Deep Work</a>, Cal Newport explains that research has shown the primary difference between experts and amateurs in a typical field is not innate talent; instead it is the amount of time they’ve spent in <em>Deliberate Practice</em> within their field of study that sets them apart.  Deliberate practice is not merely time spent working on the craft, but includes a <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/08/02/feedback-loops/">feedback loop</a> aspect. To get better at something, we need to receive meaningful feedback on whether what we’re doing is working.</p>
<p>When working with a team, one of the best ways to get this type of feedback is <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews">quality code reviews</a>.  When you’re reviewing, you get to see other developers approaches to code, and when you’ve written code, you hopefully get high quality feedback from a different point of view.</p>
<p>In reality, code reviews don’t always provide the value they could.  Many developers don’t give much feedback at all on code reviews, give unhelpful aesthetic feedback, or may even use it abusively to try to show off their “superiority”. I can’t solve all of those problems, but here are a few tips I’ve found that help me get better feedback when my code is being reviewed.</p>
<h4>1. Annotate Pull Requests</h4>
<p>Most people assume that the inline commenting features in Github and Bitbucket code reviews are for use by the people reviewing the code.  But I’ve found that it can be helpful to preemptively add comments to my PRs to give reviewers context.
This is especially useful for information that may be relevant during a code review but isn’t long term relevant, like the original reason for extracting some reusable code and where it came from.  Below is an example of a comment I left demoing how React hooks could be used to pull out shared logic in my work project.</p>

  </span>
  </a></p>
<p>These types of comments are also good ways to point a reviewer to the important parts of a review. This matters for reviews where there are many small changes across a large number of files, with a few high impact changes.  It’s always better to make atomic changes (see <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews">more here</a>), but when you must make a large change, this technique can help a lot.  I have received noticeably better feedback on my large pull requests since I began annotating</p>
<h4>2. Encourage Questions</h4>
<p>If you’re receiving feedback from more junior members of a team, they may not always be comfortable giving direct feedback on code.  One way to get better feedback in those situations is to encourage them to ask questions about things they don’t understand.  This gives them opportunities to learn, but also let’s you see which parts of your code are unintuitive or unfamiliar to the rest of the team.  In some cases the questions will expose bugs that a more confident reviewer may have pointed out straight out, and that experience can help grow a reviewers confidence and lead to even better feedback next time.</p>
<p>Of course asking questions rather than assuming understanding can be a good tactic when giving feedback in general, and is worth considering when doing your own reviews regardless of whether a reviewer has encouraged it.</p>
<h4>3. Find More Than One Reviewer</h4>
<p>This applies to more than just code, but if you’re not getting the feedback you need right now, ask somebody else.  In a work setting, this might be finding different team members to review your code.  If that isn’t possible at work, finding other ways to write code and get feedback on it can make a big difference in your career.  Not everyone has time or capacity for this, but contributing to open source, project nights at local meetups and hackathons can all be great ways to learn and get feedback from others.  If you can find a mentor to talk through code challenges with, that can be beneficial even if they aren’t on your team and going through your code line by line.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Ten Soft Skills That Will Shape Your Career]]></title>
            <link>https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/15/soft-skills</link>
            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/15/soft-skills</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular posts in the history of my blog was a list with the click-baity name <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/">Ten Things A Serious JavaScript Developer Should Learn</a>.  It explicitly focused on the set of technical skills that you need to become a “senior” JavaScript developer.  While I’m happy with that post, I’ve always wanted to revisit the idea, because it is my strong belief that <em>once you’ve hit a minimum level of technical capability, only about 20% of career success is determined by your technical skills</em>.  The other 80% is composed of skills that can be loosely bundled under “soft skills”.</p>
<p>You may quibble with my choice of percentage, but I don’t think the underlying idea that things other than technical ability is particularly controversial.  Even if they bitterly dismiss such things as “politics” most developers are aware that their careers are impacted by things that go beyond their ability to write algorithms.  What I haven’t seen much of however, are attempts to catalogue what these soft skills are, and how somebody might get better at them.  The second part is outside of the scope of a single post, though I will attempt to list resources here.  But the first is achievable, and that is what I will attempt to do here.</p>
<p>The following is not an exhaustive list, but it covers 10 “soft skills” that I’ve seen have a clear impact on my career in software and those of others.  The best part? These are things you can grow in that will have an impact in your life outside of work, and in any career you might transition into in the future.</p>
<h3>The Skills</h3>
<h4>1. Clear Communication</h4>
<p>While I’m making bold statements: A developer’s ability to communicate clearly is the single most important skill in determining the trajectory of their career.  Poor communicators are forced to rely on others to interpret their work, even when it is brilliant.  They will often create problems for others through miscommunications or lead teams to make suboptimal decisions because they were not able to explain the technical considerations involved in a situation.</p>
<p>Great communicators on the other hand, enlighten.  They help teams understand what is really going on so that non-technical team members can make good decisions, and technical folk can work with confidence.  Great communicators cut through misunderstandings, expose ambiguity and poor assumptions, and can translate for team members who are having trouble making themselves heard.</p>
<p>Communication skills are important for those on a management track, but they are just as important for those on a technical trajectory. Architects, Principal Engineers and Tech Leads must coordinate with many teams, teach less experienced developers, explain technical tradeoffs and document decisions and code.  Those are core parts of a senior technical employee’s job, and all of them come down to communication.</p>

</ul>
<h4>2. Attention Management</h4>
<p>This one is more commonly referred to as “time management”, but I agree with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html">this recent NYT Op-Ed</a>: the mechanics of how we organize our time is less important than whether we end up spending it on the most important things.  This broadly encompasses the ability to prioritize, to prevent distractions from wreaking havoc on productivity, and the ability to find ways to get back on track when things go wrong or priorities change.</p>
<p>This was a weakness for me early in my career: I got things done but often did them haphazardly or inefficiently.  One of my biggest sources of growth in the last few years has been finding ways to structure and prioritize my time better, while cutting out distractions.  This has been necessary due to life changes: I’m now a parent and have people reporting to me at work.  I wouldn’t be able to meet my current responsibilities with the habits I had as a 25 year old.  For me this has been largely about focusing in on a small amount of essential things and actively removing less important things from my life.  For others it may be more about establishing patterns and limits.  Either way, this requires planning and introspection first to be effective.</p>

</ul>
<h4>3. Initiative</h4>
<p>If you see an opportunity or a problem, do you do something about it?  I’ve been reading a good amount of “manager books” recently, and in many of them a surprising amount of focus is dedicated to the question of how we create conditions when people are “empowered” to act.  And there certainly is an environmental factor here.  People are more likely to take initiative and risks when they’re not afraid of being punished for it.  But the individual also controls a lot here.  Developers who are willing to step up and take initiative in a situation can make an outsize impact.</p>
<p>Do you have a piece of code or process on your team that everybody acknowledges is a bit wonky, but nobody has ever taken the time to fix even though it is slowly taking a toll on the team over time?  Are there simple things that you know could make your product better, but nobody has quite taken the time to get to them?  Those are the opportunities that initiative can turn into value.</p>

<li><a href="https://overreacted.io/fix-like-no-ones-watching/">Fix Like No One’s Watching</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Empathy</h4>
<p>There is no meaningful software product that has been created in isolation.  One person may have written the code (though that is quite rare for software with any scale of impact), and maybe even didn’t collaborate with anyone to handle distribution / hosting etc, but if that software is used by others there is always support, training and marketing to consider.  You can create a todo app for yourself without talking to anyone.  But nobody makes a career in this business without talking to other humans.</p>
<p>The thing about us humans; we work well with people who we trust, and who we perceive as caring about us.  We also are for the most part exceptionally good at discerning when somebody is faking it.  So if we can’t get away from humans, and we can’t be fake, what can we do?  We are left with, in the words of Dale Carnegie “becoming genuinely interested in other people”.  If you’re currently filled with red-faced frustration at your annoying co-worker or manipulative boss, this may seem like asking for a miracle. And arguably any time we look outside ourselves it is a miracle. But regardless of your philosophical outlook on such things, there are definitely ways we can improve in how we work with and care for the people around us.  And it starts with trying to empathize and seeing the people around us as human beings and not obstacles or tools.</p>

</ul>
<h4>5. Negotiation &#x26; Persuasion</h4>
<p>You may not think that Software Engineering involves much negotiation.  But that is only true if you use a shallow definition of negotiation.  Every time a team debates implementation strategies for a feature, which tickets should end up in a sprint, and how much time to spend chasing a difficult to reproduce bug, they are engaging in negotiation, and team members are attempting to persuade.  And there is a wealth of knowledge out there describing how to improve on these skills.</p>
<p>A word of caution here; unlike some of the other things on this list, these skills can often be dangerous when they’re improved in isolation.  When developers complain about politics trumping technical ability, they’re often experiencing decisions being made based on the ability of some employees to persuade and negotiate.  When those employees are not actually providing the best ideas this is suboptimal.  For the technically skilled employees, the answer is to learn to persuade better.  But for those who can negotiate we always need to make sure that we’re <strong>persuading for good</strong>.  Just like the loudest voices shouldn’t always win, when you can communicate well, make sure to stay humble and  boost other’s good ideas when you see them.</p>

<h4>6. Continual Learning</h4>
<p>Were you paying attention in high school physics when they taught about the difference between distance, velocity, and acceleration?  Distance is the amount an object has traveled.  Velocity is the speed at which it is currently moving in a given direction.  Acceleration is the rate at which the object’s velocity is changing.  If you want to know where an object is <em>right now</em>, distance is the only thing that matters.  But as time progresses, velocity starts to matter more, and in the very long term any difference in acceleration will be the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>The same ideas play out when acquiring skills.  If you need to evaluate your career potential for the next few months, the skills and accomplishments you’ve acquired so far (distance) are the only things that matter.  But if you want to think about your career potential over the next 30 years, the new skills you’re acquiring (velocity) and even more importantly your ability to get better at learning new things (acceleration) will matter much much more. Learning is a skill unto itself, and the earlier you invest in it the more dividends it will pay over time.</p>

</ul>
<h4>7. Self Care</h4>
<p>Another lesson that I’ve learned the hard way in my career is the reality of my own mortality.  None of us are indestructible, and our bodies are not perpetual energy machines.  They require care and maintenance.  Our souls too are not meant to run on work alone, and we can burn out hard without sufficient rest.  This is all aside from deeper issues of disease and mental health that can change our lives in even more profound and difficult ways.</p>
<p>Self care is a career skill because frankly we are great at deluding ourselves into thinking we’re functioning normally while we’ve compromised ourselves.  <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/07/you-might-not-know-if-youre-sleep-deprived.html">Research</a> shows that we are horrible judges of whether our judgement and creativity are compromised by lack of sleep.  Because we can’t run controlled studies on ourselves, we don’t really know whether our lack of exercise or 60 hour workweek induced burnout are hurting our creativity.  But research suggests it is for pretty much everybody.</p>
<p>Healthy socialization, sleeping, eating and exercise ultimately lead to better emotional stability, ability to focus, and creativity.  But even aside from the career benefits, when we’re devouring our bodies and minds for work, it leads to a question of what we’re doing this for in the first place.</p>

</ul>
<h4>8. Business Awareness</h4>
<p>Do you know what your company actually does?  Do you understand why the features you’re building are important, and the relative priority of them?  Can you explain the business tradeoffs involved when you’re making an software architecture decision between performance and security?</p>
<p>In companies larger than a few people it’s not ultimately developers’ jobs to make business decisions.  But understanding the context for those decisions helps us better prioritize our time, make good tradeoffs, and call attention to inefficiencies or counterproductive behavior in our products. In addition, nobody wants to spend time working on things that don’t matter. But when we try to innovate without understanding the broader business, we often end up doing just that.</p>

<h4>9. Marketing and Branding</h4>
<p>Marketing is a dirty word in engineering circles.  Many take the attitude of the Dilbert comics that <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1997-05-02">marketing is a synonym for exaggeration lying, and fraud</a>.  But at it’s core marketing is just making sure that the people who could benefit from your services are aware of those services.  This has several applications to developers.  In the job market, finding ways to let employers know who you are and what you’re capable of is important.  But in medium to large companies it also is important to do some level of internal marketing; to make sure you’re credited for the work you’ve done and that people understand it’s values.  Developers who consider themselves above this or dismiss it as politics do so at their own peril.</p>

</ul>
<h4>10. Character</h4>
<p>The final item here is in some ways an oddball.  While the other 9 things on this list are skills that you can work on, character is something deeper.  Questions of what good character is and how you develop it are way outside the scope of this post.  And I would personally consider any attempt to improve your character for solely utilitarian career reasons to be ultimately hollow.  But character is undeniably important in your career.</p>
<p>Do the people around you trust you?  Do they believe that you’re trying to do the right thing?  If the answers are no, you may find obstacles in the most unexpected places.  If the answers are yes, you will eventually find help from people you would never have looked to.</p>
<p>In addition, as an industry, technology has the power to shape the world, and as practitioners we all get the chance to impact our little corners of the world.  It’s worth considering not just whether we’re “succeeding in our career”, but what impact we’re having on the world around us.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Consistency]]></title>
            <link>https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/01/consistency</link>
            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/01/consistency</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few weeks I’ve had several conversations with a coworker about consistency in code: why do we do things one way here, and a different way there?  Some of this is macro level; Where do we split chunks of related functionality into different files?  Some of it is micro level; what should the rules be for when we use an inline function instead of pulling it out into its own named method?  Some of it is trivial; Do we use <code class="language-text">_</code> or <code class="language-text">-</code> to separate words in file names?  In our current codebase we’re not always consistent on many of these issues.  As we’ve discussed the various issues, I realized that some of them bothered me more than others, and (more interestingly to me) my ideas have changed here over time.</p>
<h3>The Platonic Ideal</h3>
<blockquote>
<p> In a perfectly consistent system, 3 developers writing the same module would produce line by line identical code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s an extreme point of view out there that says “while a perfectly consistent system might not be possible, the closer we can get to that the better”.  The benefits of consistency are many: consistent naming helps with code search and connecting different parts of a system.  Consistent code structure makes code easier to scan once a developer is familiar with the system, and it makes exceptions stand out as something intentional and interesting.  Consistent formatting removes potential distractions.   So what’s not to love?  Shouldn’t we always try to add more consistency?  I see 2 primary reasons why it might not be worth trying to enforce every single rule we can come up with.</p>
<h4>We’re only human</h4>
<p>The first reason not to enforce “everything” is that our human attention spans can only internalize so many rules at once.  When we’re trying to remember a large number of rules, its easy to miss one.  But more importantly, when we’re writing code or reviewing it, focusing too much on human enforced consistency rules can distract from the actual purpose of the code, making it harder to notice the substance of code because we’re so focused on the form.</p>
<h4>Standards too soon</h4>
<p>The other thing that can happen when you try to standardize everything is a loss of creativity.  Sometimes it’s helpful to experiment for a while to find the right pattern in a codebase.  In an ideal situation experiments like that will happen on the side, or be explored in branches, but for small teams or new codebases, it will likely happen at least partially in production.</p>
<h3>User Friendly Consistency</h3>
<p>So what <strong>can</strong> we do to get the benefits of consistency? The 4 ways I like to see this happen are:</p>
<h4>Automation</h4>
<p>The best way to enforce stylistic consistency and other straightforward things like naming conventions is to use automation.  Linters like <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> and auto-formatters like <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>.  My rule here is that any linter rule that is about stylistic consistency should be auto-fixable, if not it isn’t clear enough or isn’t worth it.  For “correctness rules” it can be ok to flag errors without auto-fixing, if human judgement is needed.</p>
<h4>Code Review Checklists</h4>
<p>Code reviews can be a good way to limitedly enforce consistency; but its good to limit scope to avoid <a href="https://samsaccone.com/posts/code-reviews-not-nits.html">developers trying to become human compilers</a>.  If you try to enforce too many things in code reviews, its easy for people to get caught up in going through a list and forget to apply human judgement to the context of the current code. But <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/14/value-from-code-reviews">code review checklists</a> are a good way to make a coordinated push on high value items that are either new or often neglected.  This checklist should consist of a few important things to check during every review. The list should be re-examined on a regular basis and ideally kept to 5 or less items.</p>
<h4>Focused Refactoring</h4>
<p>Sometimes its appropriate to have “refactoring initiatives” to standardize on a particular pattern over time.  This can be good for standardizing on a particular library for a task, or removing an older pattern that persists in the codebase after a better way has been found.  My advice here is to <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/">only do one of these at a time, and complete them before starting a new one</a>.  One of the biggest causes of inconsistency is when a team attempts to ”<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">standardize</a>” on a solution, then abandons that for a new solution without finish the migration, resulting in a <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html">lava layer architecture</a>.</p>
<h4>Focus on the high level</h4>
<p>If there is one place to apply human consistency checks its at the structural level.  If your high level patterns are consistent, the code base will be easy to navigate, and modular code written in a standardized high level structure will be <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">easy to delete</a>.  Overall low level code that is inconsistent or poorly written is easier to overcome than high level code as long as you’re taking advantage of code reviews and the other methods suggested here to improve new code, because most low level code is only read occasionally.  So high traffic “messy code” can be a focus of refactoring efforts, and the rest can continue working without disturbing anything.</p>
<p>Messy code is much more problematic at a structural level though, because when different areas of the code are arranged in different ways, it becomes much harder to find functionality when debugging.  This type of inconsistency also tends to make bulk improvements harder, as you have to have a much greater understanding of all the ways a codebase is put together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 6 months I’ve been serving as a hybrid developer/engineering manager.  It’s been an interesting experience, and because this is a fairly common way to transition into engineering management<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, I thought it might be worthwhile to share some lessons I’ve learned so far.</p>
<h4>1. Time discipline is key</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge of this transition was learning to be a manager.  It’s a whole new job!  But the biggest challenge specific to the management/developer split has been managing my time.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a bit loose with my time management.  I do a lot based on my mental state at a particular time; if I’m tired or uninspired I may lean more into grunt work like documentation, code reviews, or more “scripted” code work.  If I’m in the zone I’ll dive into big tasks, and if someone comes to me with a problem I tend to context shift into it and go from there.</p>
<p>This “time management strategy” hasn’t held up at all while trying to balance manager and development strategies.  Basically because of the blend of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">maker and manager schedules</a>.  Developers need long uninterrupted periods of time to be productive, while managers tend to operate on a much more social and interrupt driven schedule.  They’re naturally opposed.</p>
<p>Working with this tension requires discipline and planning.  For me personally I’ve started planning my schedule for the next day at the end of the previous day, batching my checking of Slack/email and being more thoughtful when somebody asks for my time.</p>
<p><strong>Planning my schedule for the next day</strong> is a tip I picked up from <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/09/book-review-deep-work-common-rule">Deep Work</a>.  To close out the day, I review the things I’ll need to handle the next day, and block out my calendar with time for different tasks for the next day.  This does mean that my calendar <em>always looks completely booked for the current day</em>.  So far this has served as a feature not a bug; I can still move things if something urgent comes up and it has a way of encouraging people to schedule less urgent things in advance.  Note that scheduling like this doesn’t mean you can’t change plans; I do all the time.  It just means that you start with a plan and can be thoughtful about how you vary off of it.</p>
<p><strong>Batching Slack and email</strong> has been something I’ve known would be good for me forever.  It feels good in the moment to be the guy who is constantly available, but the cost of distraction is higher than you think.  So far, management has been a catalyst for me buckling down here.</p>
<p>Finally, I get a lot more unexpected requests for my time now than I did previously.  I’ve found that batching my email and Slack reading combined with <strong>a willingness to suggest a meeting later in the day or the next morning rather than <em>right now</em></strong> has helped me protect blocks of productivity and focus, without making me an unresponsive manager.  Most things can sit for 2 hours without blowing up anyone’s day.  The key is to ask enough to identify the 5% of things that can’t wait.</p>
<p>Those 3 tactics have worked for me, but overall it comes down to being intentional about your time.  If you let yourself be blown by the wind while splitting dual responsibilities, one of them will almost always receive the short end of the stick.</p>
<h4>2. Team success metrics are the only ones that matter</h4>
<p>When you’re acting as both a developer and a manager, it can be tempting to hold yourselves to 2 sets of metrics: management metrics and development metrics.  This is a mistake.  It will cause you to over-prioritize your own tasks and hurt your team’s long term growth.</p>
<p>Focusing on personal development metrics and goals can lead to over-prioritizing them for a few reasons. First, development goals tend to be much “cleaner” than management goals; it’s easier to tell what you’ve achieved.  Second, if you’re transitioning into this role from a dev role, you probably are much more comfortable with these tasks, and so they can act as a safe place where you avoid having to stretch yourself.  And finally, if you moved into this role from a senior dev position, it can be easy to tell yourself that this is actually the best way to get stuff done.  And you may be right… in the short term.</p>
<p>So what’s the antidote?  Focus on team productivity and view your own work as just an extra card you have to play in your hand.  It’s an advantage you have over less technical managers, but if you don’t set to working developing other strengths, you’re not going to be able to grow, and if you’re monopolizing the important work your team won’t be able to step up into new roles.  So play that card, but do it with caution, and always as a means rather than an end.</p>
<h4>3. This isn’t long term sustainable; have a plan</h4>
<p>Hybrid Management / Developer roles aren’t a long term game.  Aside from the scheduling tension I mentioned above, once you move into this role you’re either going to be slowly giving up responsibilities and watching your tech skills slowly move off the cutting edge as you focus on learning how to manager your team and developing others to fill the roles you once did, or you’re going to be failing as a manager as you try to cling too tightly to your senior individual contributor responsibilities.  So if you want to avoid that, it’s important to be evaluating how you want your career to evolve.  A role like this can be a first step up a chain, or part of a <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">dev to manager pendulum</a>.  You also might discover that management isn’t for you and decide to move back.  I’m committed to this for a set period of time, and that’s helped me to work through the days when I wonder what I actually accomplished, and think strategically about what I need to get better at.</p>
<h4>4. Best Management resources</h4>
<p>So this isn’t a learning so much, but as a newbie manager, probably the best thing I can do is point you to the resources I’ve found helpful.  So here are some of the best.</p>
<p><strong>On Engineering Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a> by Michael Lopp and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Clyjvy">the book he pulled out of the blog</a> are great little snippets of engineering management gold</li>
<li><a href="https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=1f50ce22f02ed0ffc80c10aff&#x26;id=8c0f947e69">Lara Hogan’s Newsletter</a> is full of useful advice, and she’s really good about including exercises to help practice what she’s describing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Management Generally</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2F4i0ni">Radical Candor</a> is the single most helpful thing I’ve read while trying to figure out this whole management thing</li>
<li>Patrick Lencioni’s books are all told as “leadership fables” which can seem a bit weird, but in the squishy imprecise world of management, stories can be very effective ways to teach.  I’ve read <a href="https://amzn.to/2UCPpvT">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2UIaxkr">Death By Meeting</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2CqYalR">Silos, Politics, and Turf Wars</a>.  They’ve all been great and I plan to read more of his stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Structuring My Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I reviewed it last week, but <a href="https://amzn.to/2UBcIGy">Deep Work</a> was super helpful in thinking through how to balance my time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Career Path</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I linked this one above, but if you didn’t click through then Charity Major’s post on the <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">Engineer/Manager Pendulum</a> has been really helpful for pushing me to think through where I want to go next.</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>I’m aware that lots of folks would say that this is a very <em>bad</em> way to start management and that you should stop coding when you become a manager, but it isn’t always possible to fully control what opportunities are available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’ve gone through projects over time, I’ve found a few functions that I end up creating for every significant project that I’ve worked on.  Some of the details differ from project to project, but the basic function remains the same.  I thought it would be helpful to do a rundown:</p>
<h3>React/JSX</h3>
<p>Some of my utils are focused on making JSX nicer to deal with.  2 situations that I’ve run into a lot in JSX are conditionally showing an item in JSX, and determining which of several classes to add to an element based on logic.  Scenarios like these:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>div<span class="token operator">></span>
    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>shouldShowCreateButton <span class="token operator">?</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>Button
            onClick<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>createWidget<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
            type <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'primary'</span>
            size <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Large'</span>
            disabled <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">!</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
            className<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'create-button'</span>
        <span class="token operator">></span>
            Create Widget
        <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>Button<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>div<span class="token operator">></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">let</span> classNames <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'create-button'</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>extraClass<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    classNames <span class="token operator">+=</span> <span class="token string">' '</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> extraClass<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    classNames <span class="token operator">+=</span> <span class="token string">' is-disabled'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>hasCreateError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    classNames <span class="token operator">+=</span> <span class="token string">' has-error'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>Button
        onClick<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>createWidget<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        type <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'primary'</span>
        size <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Large'</span>
        disabled <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">!</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        className<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>classNames<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token operator">></span>
        Create Widget
<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>Button<span class="token operator">></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are both ok, and you’ll see plenty of examples of code like them out there, but the first puts a big chunk of code in a ternary, and it’s not always going to be clear to a reader where that <code class="language-text">: null</code> came from at the end, or why it’s there by the time they reach the end.</p>
<p>In the second example, we’re dealing with a lot of ugly string concatenation.  There are other ways to handle this, like using template strings + ternaries but generally they each provide their own messy pieces.</p>
<p>To solve these situations, I like to define these 2 small functions:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">import</span> isString <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'lodash-es/isString'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> filter <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'lodash-es/filter'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token comment">// A helper for React Components to reduce ternary use</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">showIf</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">condition<span class="token punctuation">,</span> element</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>condition <span class="token operator">?</span> element <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token comment">// A helper for handling class lists where some values may be undefined</span>
<span class="token comment">// filters out anything that isn't a string and then adds spaces</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">classes</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token parameter">classList</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token function">filter</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>classList<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token parameter">c</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token function">isString</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>c<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> c<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length <span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">join</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">' '</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first just formalizes the most common use of ternaries in JSX (conditionally showing an item) and adds an easy to understand name to it.</p>
<p>The second lets us work with an array of classNames instead of handling string concat ourselves, and will automatically filter out undefined or empty classNames.  This implementation does silently swallow errors on anything that is not a string, which may not be your preference.  Usage looks like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>div<span class="token operator">></span>
    <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function">showIf</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>shouldShowCreateButton<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>Button
            onClick<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>createWidget<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
            type <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'primary'</span>
            size <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Large'</span>
            disabled <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">!</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
            className<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'create-button'</span>
        <span class="token operator">></span>
            Create Widget
        <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>Button<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>div<span class="token operator">></span></code></pre></div>
<p>the showIf reads much more clearly than the previous ternary, especially for language newbies who might not be used to ternaries.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">let</span> classNames <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'create-button'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> extraClass<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    classNames<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">push</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'is-disabled'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>hasCreateError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    classNames<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">push</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'has-error'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>Button
        onClick<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>createWidget<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        type <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'primary'</span>
        size <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Large'</span>
        disabled <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">!</span>createEnabled<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        className<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function">classes</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>classNames<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token operator">></span>
        Create Widget
<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>Button<span class="token operator">></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we’ve gotten rid of the extra string code and are working on arrays, which is a nicer data structure for dealing with lists of stuff. Also since we’re auto-filtering falsy stuff, we don’t have to worry about whether extraClass was defined if it was passed as a prop to our component or something.</p>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>So the next few may be different for everyone.  The details here aren’t important, the important thing is that you centralize your formatting of numbers and dates.  For instance, here are functions for formatting dates, normal numbers and percentages from a current project:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> format <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'date-fns'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> isNumber <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'lodash-es/isNumber'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token comment">// takes either a string or a date object and formats it as a standard date with time</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">stdFormat</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token parameter">dateStr</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token operator">!</span>dateStr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">return</span> dateStr<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token keyword">let</span> date <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>dateStr<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token function">format</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>date<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'MM/DD/YY hh:mm A'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">commafy</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">num<span class="token punctuation">,</span> minDecimals <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<p>The first one will take a date object and format it to something like <code class="language-text">05/30/17 01:16 PM</code>.  The second will take a number and return a string formatted with appropriate commas: <code class="language-text">1234567 -&gt; &#39;1,234,567&#39;</code>.  The last one will convert a decimal to a percentage string: <code class="language-text">0.5 -&gt; &#39;50%&#39;</code>.</p>
<p>Note that none of these functions are very long.  I’m relying on a date library for the first piece and <code class="language-text">toLocaleString</code> for the other 2.  So I could inline this in most places and not have it get much longer.  The benefit of these types of functions is not in saving typing.  It’s in standardizing how you format or don’t format things throughout an application.  This has 2 benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s easy to fix bugs, add features or switch between libraries for these common tasks across your application because all of the logic is centralized.  If I needed to start supporting more locales than just the US for percentage formatting, or use moment for my date formatting library I could easily do so with edits to only one file.  That file is also well unit tested, so those transitions would be safe.</li>
<li>It lets us control which formats are allowed.  For instance we’re allowing the function caller to specify how many decimal points to show for the numeric functions, but not giving options to change the date format for the formatting function, because we want that to be the same everywhere.  If we need to support multiple formats for different scenarios, like a date-only format or a format for communicating with the API, we can add options for that which don’t open up all formats, or expose them as separate functions.  With dates in particular, I want imports of libraries like moment or date-fns to be limited to 2 or 3 files at the most, and not used ad-hoc throughout the codebase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that all my examples so far have utilized other utility libraries like lodash and date-fns.  The best utility functions are those that you don’t have to maintain yourself.  I do recommend looking for libraries that you can tree-shake and only take what you need though.  Other ones like moment.js can make a big difference on your JavaScript bundle size if you let them.</p>
<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>Timeout functions are useful, but the browsers built in functions are callback based and don’t play well with promises or async await.  We can fix that:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">sleep</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token parameter">secs</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Promise</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">res</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token function">setTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>res<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secs <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token number">1000</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">pause</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token function">sleep</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I now have a promisified version of setTimeout (<code class="language-text">sleep</code>) and a special case version with a 0 timeout (useful for things that should happen as soon as possible after the current event loop executes. I prefer dealing with things in seconds over milliseconds, so I changed the API to use that.  That is probably not everyone’s cup of tea, so feel free to copy and modify.</p>
<p>Usage looks like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// function to kick off a "job" of some type and then</span>
<span class="token comment">// check every 30 seconds to see if the job is complete</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">createJobAndShowResults</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function">createJob</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token comment">// don't do this without a timeout/failure</span>
    <span class="token comment">// condition in real life!</span>
    <span class="token keyword">while</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">sleep</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">30</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">let</span> jobStatus <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">checkIfJobIsCompleted</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>jobStatus<span class="token punctuation">.</span>complete<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="token keyword">return</span> jobStatus<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>And Even More!</h3>
<p>This is just a sample of the small functions I usually create in projects.  Pretty much all of them exist for one or more of the reasons that were already discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smoothing over awkward library syntax like multiple classes in JSX or HTML templates</li>
<li>Making user intention clear with a well named function, like showIf or stdDateFormat</li>
<li>Ensuring consistent application-specific behavior across common low-level operations like formatting or logging</li>
<li>Making it easy to replace 3rd party utility libraries  like date-fns by wrapping them in an application specific function</li>
<li>Improving browser level APIs, or shaping them to have useful defaults for the current application, like we did with toLocaleString and setTimeout.</li>
