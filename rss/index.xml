            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 was the 5th full year of this blog, and I chose to experiment a bit.  For the first 9 months of the year, I posted a Weekly Links post every week, and also published 24 normal articles, before taking a break the last 3 months to deal with some changes in work and home life.  My employer went through an acquisition this year and I started working with a new team. Then Claire and I welcomed our first daughter, Elena, to the world earlier this month.  It’s been a busy but rewarding year.</p>

<p>I’m excited to get back to the blog in 2019, and take what I’ve learned the last few years and make some improvements I’ve been considering for a while.  The biggest one is shifting to a newsletter format for initially publishing my posts.</p>
<h2>Newsletter</h2>
<p>Over the last year, email newsletters have become my favorite ways to stay up to date in my professional world.  High quality newsletters from people like <a href="https://buttondown.email/kentcdodds">Kent</a>, <a href="https://larahogan.me/sign-up/">Lara</a>, and <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/weekly">Ponyfoo</a> are some of the best ways to both keep up with what’s going on tech and trends, but also learn new ideas in a blog post, way.  It’s a better forum for thoughtful content than social media, allows for communication between the writer and their audience.</p>
<p>I’ve always allowed people to subscribe to this blog through email, but to be honest, the experience has been kind of crappy.  I’ve meant to improve my email template forever, and articles sometimes got jumbled into a single email.  Going forward, they’re going to be a first class citizen, and the best way to follow the blog.  I’ll publish articles there first, and include extra “weekly link” like content in the emails only.  I’m switching emails over to <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> and they should be much cleaner and content focused going forward.  If you follow this blog through email, you’re probably reading this post in that format now.  If not, please go ahead and <a href="https://benmccormick.org/subscribe/">subscribe</a>.  I’ll be starting the year with a series of posts about front end architecture.</p>
<h2>2018 Roundup</h2>
<h3>Most Read Posts Published in 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/07/react-confessions/">React Architecture Confessions</a> React unquestioningly has a learning curve.  I decided to talk through the various mistakes I’d made as I learned React on the fly while building a large web application.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/07/04/evil-javascript/">Evil JavaScript</a> This was something different for me, a tongue-in-cheek look at the ways you can use and abuse some of JavaScript’s more powerful features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/06/05/es6-the-bad-parts/">ES6: The Bad Parts</a>

<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2018</h3>
<p>With all the changes, it hasn’t been a big year for experimentation, but Immer is fantastic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mweststrate/immer">Immer</a> This probably deserves a full post at some point, but I’ve been experimenting with using only Immer and React’s built in state features for state management on a new project, and it’s been fairly nice so far.  It’s a lovely little library that makes working with immutable data pleasant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> My other big experiment on the new project has been using Storybook as a collaboration tool for our UI components.  It’s still early days, but I’m liking it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2018</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, lodash, MobX, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules</p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2019</h3>
<p>I want to try building some small hardware projects and automating them this year.  Something completely different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to a plethora of life events happening this year, I’m going to be putting the blog on pause for a while.  So no more updates through the end of the year.  Will re-evaluate then and hopefully start things back up.  I have plans to take the weekly links stuff I’ve been doing the past year and turn it into a real email newsletter with a better template, and some exciting ideas for a new blog series.  But I lack the capacity to follow up on them for now.  So Happy Holidays in advance everybody, I hope to be back early next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/blackrock-engineering/5-common-mistakes-with-keys-in-react-b86e82020052">Common Mistakes with Keys in React | Li He</a></p>
<p>This was a nice summary of a topic that lots of people likely breeze over in React until it burns them.  Short and informative; good stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/extracting-command-line-arguments-nodejs/">Extracting command line arguments from Node.js using destructuring |  Nicholas C. Zakas</a></p>
<p>Destructuring is one of those JavaScript featurs that it’s easy to go a little crazy with.  You go from not knowing it exists to writing expressions like this in a day<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="javascript">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>user<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>fname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userFirstName <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Jon'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> lname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userLastName<span class="token operator">=</span> 'Smith<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> data<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>

<p>That type of thing will drive the people reading your programs crazy eventually.  This article provides a nice example of where destructuring shines.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.attack-gecko.net/2018/09/04/followership/">Followership | Jason Wong</a></p>
<p>This is a really interesting breakdown of “follower styles”.  I’ll admit I’m a sucker for 2x2 grid frameworks, but I love em because they’re powerful communication tools.  I’ll be thinking about how I can use this with my team, as well as thinking about how I relate to those in authority over me.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>That sets 2 variables, <code class="language-text">userFirstName</code> and <code class="language-text">userLastName</code> pulling them from <code class="language-text">data.user.fname</code> and <code class="language-text">data.user.lname</code> respectively, and defaulting them to John and Smith if they’re not defined. …obviously?</p>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/principles-of-component-api-prop-design-bb20cd58da54">Principles of Component API Design | Chris Schmitz</a></p>
<p>Good advice for designing React components</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a></p>
<p>A new Git tool from the makers of Sublime Text.  Looks lightning fast, good looking and usable.  Exactly what you’d expect.  I’m not a big UI guy for Git, but I’ll be playing with this, and it might be my new go-to recommendation.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OqjY8u">The Everything Store | Brad Stone</a></p>
<p>Still finishing this one up, but can already recommend it.  A great look into the creation of one of the most important companies in the world.  I was pretty interested to read about how intense Jeff Bezos is, and how hard he ran the early employees of Amazon.  I hadn’t realized that he fell into the Steve Job’s school of CEO-hood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Javascript &#x26; the Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/">The Rise of Immer | Shawn Wang</a></p>
<p>I’m a few weeks late on this one, but it is worth your time.  Shawn breaks down a new trend in React state management: the increasing popularity of Immer as a base for improving state management APIs.  I’m particularly interested in <a href="https://github.com/aweary/react-copy-write">react-copy-write</a> as a new simpler paradigm for React state management.  Right now Redux has “won” that space, and MobX is the clear second option, but it still feels like there’s room for improvement and new options.  Will be cool to see what people build on top of immer.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-fail-as-a-new-engineering-manager-30b5fb617a">How to fail as a new engineering manager | Brad Armstrong</a></p>
<p>As a new engineering manager, I found this list super helpful.  I can already feel the temptation to fall into many of these traps, and it’s encouraging to hear about them from somebody who has gone ahead of me.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2xzyhho">Every Good Endeavor | Tim Keller</a></p>
<p>This is a “Christian book”, but I think it would be interesting to anyone who is interested in thinking about why we work, and how we find meaning in our work.  If you are a Christian, there’s lots of insight here connecting the truths of our faith to the rhythms of our work lives.  If you’re not, there is plenty to provoke thought, because the questions this book raises; why do we work? why is work often so unfulfilling? How do we find our purpose?; are universal questions regardless of whether you agree with Keller’s answers or foundational beliefs.  Highly recommended.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is a smart set of criteria to consider when looking at new tools.  I’d add that it’s always worth comparing a library to a “do it without the library” approach, to make sure you understand the benefits that you’re getting for your specific project.</p>

<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2xfflEi">Ready Player One | Ernest Cline</a></p>
<p>I’m about 7 years late on this (and even 6 months late for the movie hype), but Ready Player one was a great little sci-fi novel that uses 80’s pop culture as a background for a bunch of insightful commentary about our modern tech culture and where it may be heading.  A lot of fun, and worth reading if you’ve missed it for this long like me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://stateofjs.com/">State of JS Survey | Raphaël Benitte, Sacha Greif &#x26; Michael Rambeau</a></p>
<p>This survey is always a great look into the JavaScript community, and it just opened for this year.  If you’re reading this, please fill it out.  I’ll look forward to seeing what they’ve learned in a few months.</p>
<h3>Books For Programmers</h3>
<p>It’s a bit of a slow week links wise, so this week I want to share some of my favorite “timeless” programming books.  These are books that will still be relevant in 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2wVjXyi">The Pragmatic Programmer | Andy Hunt &#x26; David Thomas</a></p>
<p>My favorite book on general programming “tactics”.  Lots of code level tips and tricks here, as well as some higher level architecture thinking.  Some of the specific examples have aged out, but the general concepts discussed in this book are timeless.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2mKoejo">Clean Architecture | Robert Martin</a></p>
<p>I reviewed this one <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/">earlier this year</a>, and it’s a relatively new book, but I’m confident that it is built to last.  This is a great book on programming “strategy”, the high level construction of maintainable programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NpJyK7">How To Win Friends And Influence People | Dale Carnegie</a></p>
<p>Not a programming book, but for most programmers who have achieved a minimal level of technical proficiency, the best thing they can do to get better in their career is not more technical growth, but instead growth on their “soft” skills.  Communicating complex topics, helping teams work well together, working through interpersonal issues, negotiation and persuasion are all huge skills for professional software developers.</p>
<p>There are lots of “business” books out there that are worthwhile, but this is the best book I’ve ever read on the simple yet endlessly deep topic of relating to our fellow human beings.  It has been relevant and helpful for 82 years, and I wouldn’t expect that to change soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.angularindepth.com/practical-application-of-reverse-engineering-guidelines-and-principles-784c004bb657">Reverse Engineering React | Angular In Depth</a></p>
<p>A really cool look at how you can approach a new code base and start learning how it works quickly</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>
<p><a href="https://pybowler.io">Bowler | Facebook Open Source</a></p>
<p>This looks like “JSCOdeshift for Python” to me: a way to quickly update codebases to use new patterns and practices.  I love it. You can <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/06/18/codemod-survival/">check out my experience using JavaScript Codemods here</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a></p>
<p>bat is a prettier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)">cat</a>:  dump a file into the terminal, but use syntax highlighting and line numbers.  Good stuff for anyone who lives on the command line.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript and the Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/bits/">Bits | Ethan Marcotte</a></p>
<p>I’ll pretty much always link performance posts that do a good job laying out the challenges in a way that respects both the technical and business POV.  Ethan advocates here for a more structural view to performance problems on the web and wonders how we can find more performant ways to solve businesses revenue problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/react">React Community Resources | Egghead</a></p>
<p>Egghead has accumulated a pretty amazing set of beginner React resources that are free for non-members.  If you’re trying to get into React, this is a pretty good place to start.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2vX6yGo">Radical Candor | Kim Scott</a></p>
<p>I may write this up as a full review later, but Radical Candor was the best book I’ve read this year.  It’s a book for managers, but it really was just one of the best books I’ve ever read on communication and relationships.  If you want to work better with others, Radical Candor is worth buying.</p>]]></content:encoded>
