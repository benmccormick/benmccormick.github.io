            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 was the 5th full year of this blog, and in many ways it was the most productive.  I wrote one of the most popular things I’ve written on here, started the weekly links section (on hiatus for New Years, but will return next week), and wrote 21 full articles and 8 weekly links post, the most I’ve ever posted here in a year.  Here are some of the highlights from my blog and development this year.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I think there’s a hunger out there for clearer roadmaps for folks who are early out in their front end development career.  People are telling them to learn all the frameworks, all the tools and all the compile-to-JS languages, and everyone knows they can’t learn it all.  So even an imperfect list that can serve as a starting point for figuring that out can get some traction.  This article was my attempt to answer “what should a serious mid-level JavaScript developer have learned and be learning?“.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">How To Follow The JavaScript Roadmap</a> - This post was aimed at a similar audience to the “Serious JavaScript Developer” post, but aimed to help folks who want to follow changes in the JavaScript language keep up with new developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/03/orthogonality-and-css-in-js/">Orthogonality and CSS in JS</a> - This article was an examination of the architecture tradeoffs of CSS in JS solutions, and also an examination of how people discuss “separations of concerns” in general.  If you liked this one, keep your eyes open.  I’m planning on writing more architecture level posts in 2018.</p>

<h3>Code I wrote in 2017</h3>
<p>Most of the code I wrote this year was again for my work at Windsor Circle.  But I’ve continued to add new features to this blog, which is based on React and Gatsby, and the source code for that is available <a href="https://github.com/benmccormick/benmccormickorg">on Github</a>.</p>
<h3>Talks I gave in 2017</h3>
<p>This was a big speaking year for me.  I gave 3 different talks: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/vim-survival-guide-71763917">The Vim Survival Guide</a> at Open Source 101, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro">Intro to Gatsby</a> at a local meetup group and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/saving-time-by-testing-with-jest">Saving Time with Jest</a> at All Things Open.  I’d be interested in giving any of those talks again next year, so if you’re looking for a speaker, feel free to reach out.</p>
<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">Mobx</a> is a JavaScript data modeling library that serves as an alternative to Redux or React state for state management.  I wrote about my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/09/mobx-first-impressions/">first impressions</a> at the beginning of the year, but I’ve continued to use it and love it since then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a> was a nice upgrade over npm.  My understanding is that npm has since stepped up and closed the gap here, but I’m continuing to use Yarn for now since it has taken over my projects and muscle memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I upgraded this blog to Gatsby 1.0, I had the opportunity to learn about <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>.  I’ve really enjoyed getting to play with it and love the GraphQL community’s dedication to providing a great developer experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, Backbone (<strong>sigh</strong>), lodash, MobX, Jest</p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2018</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory">Victory</a>, Rust, and Pandas/other python data analysis libraries <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Blogs I started following in 2017</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/">Mark Erikson’s Dev blog</a></p>
<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2017</h3>

<h3>Podcasts I started listening to in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theallusionist.org/">The Allusionist</a> - A great podcast on the crazy history behind different words in the English language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> - I mentioned I was testing this out at the end of last year, but it has become my go-to notes application, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a stylish notes app in the middle ground between Apple Notes and Evernote (and who uses Apple products).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari/Firefox, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, Instapaper, iMessage, Slack, Trello, 1Password, Atom/Vim, iTerm, Fish Shell, Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear, Annotate, Dash</p>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>Yes this is basically the same list as last year.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mostly learn tech as I have need for it, and it was a very “nose to the grindstone” year focused on improving existing codebases this year</p>

<p><a href="http://raganwald.com/2017/12/14/73939133.html">73,939,133 / Truncatable Primes | Reg Braithwaite</a> - A nice writeup about how brute force can be useful in solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> style math problem.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/12/18/jest-22.html">Jest 22: Refinements &#x26; Custom Runners | Jest Blog</a> - This looks like a solid refinement release for Jest.  One warning: If you’re running <code>jest -o</code> on precommit hooks as I described <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/">here</a>, Jest 22 fails when run with 0 tests, so you need to specify the <code>--passWithNoTests</code> flag in order to let things go when you make a change that doesn’t affect any tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-12-20-introducing-the-gatsby-ux-research-program/">Introducing The Gatsby UX Research Program | Gatsby Blog</a> - An unusual case of doing real UX research for an open source developer tool.  Very cool stuff.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat">Google Maps’s Moat</a> - If you have any interest in product design, maps, or computer intelligence, this is the one article you need to read this week.  Beautifully put together.  It’s an in depth examination of the difference between Google and Apple maps, but it reads as a deeper exploration of how big data combined with computer learning and automation can have a huge impact on product design.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://stateofjs.com/">The State Of JavaScript 2017</a> - This annual survey of JavaScript developers always has lots of interesting insights.  Since it is an internet survey, I view it less as a full snapshot of the industry, but more as a place to see what is new and trending in the JS world.  This year <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> caught my eye as spiking in popularity.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/12/the-glimmer-binary-experience">The Glimmer Binary Experience | LinkedIn Engineering</a> - I had the privilege of seeing Yehuda Katz, one of the Ember core developers, give a talk about <a href="https://glimmerjs.com/">Glimmer</a> and bytecode at this year’s All Things Open conference.  They’re doing some pretty serious software engineering in the Ember community right now.  This write-up covers a lot of the same ground and is worth a read.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.atom.io/2017/12/12/atom-1-23.html">Atom 1.23</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_19">Visual Studio Code 1.19</a> were released this week, making this a big week for Electron based text editors.  If you use either of them, you’ll get to enjoy a nice set of performance improvements when you upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.bear-writer.com/bear-1-4-the-tags-edition-298d6fdc55dd">Bear 1.4</a> - Speaking of software that I love to use getting updates, I’ve been using Bear as my primary notes app for the last year, and it is a delight.  Getting autocomplete on tags this week solved it’s last real annoyance for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a simple notes app.  It’s more powerful than Apple’s notes or text files, but cleaner and more elegant than <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.  And even the paid level is very affordable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the first of 12 issues over the next year and it was a strong (but slow start).  If you’re interested in Watchmen but don’t read a lot of comics, this is the continuation of a story that began with <a href="http://amzn.to/2jD0Y5c">a big DC special</a> and continued in a special <a href="http://amzn.to/2i5zSDn">Batman/Flash crossover</a></p>

            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2017/11/28/sieveoferatosthenes/</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a way of keeping my math skills sharp, I’ve recently started to work through the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> set of computational math problems.  They ask you not to post your work publicly, so I won’t be posting about any of my specific solutions, but I did think it would be fun to share about a helper method I’ve been using.</p>
<p>For several of the Project Euler problems I’ve worked on, I needed to be able to generate a list of prime numbers.  To do that, I borrowed a Python implementation of the Sieve Of Erathosthenes from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/568618/1424361">this StackOverflow answer</a>.  Since I haven’t had much reason to use generators in JavaScript yet, I thought it would be fun to translate that algorithm to JavaScript and share that here.</p>
<h3>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h3>
<p>The Sieve of Erathosthenes is a very old<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> simple algorithm for identifying prime numbers.  In its normal implementation it is a useful way of finding small primes up to a certain number.  Beginning at 2, the algorithm iterates upward.  For the current number, if the number has not been marked, we identify it as a prime, and then mark all multiples of that number up to our target number.  So to find all primes up to 12, we would</p>
<ul>
<li>start at 2, note <strong>2</strong> as prime, and mark 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 as non-prime</li>
<li>move to 3, note <strong>3</strong> as prime, and mark 6, 9, 12 as non-prime</li>
<li>move to 4, see that it is marked, and skip it</li>
<li>move to 5, note <strong>5</strong> as prime and mark 10 as non-prime</li>
<li>move to 6, see that it is marked and skip it</li>
<li>move to 7 , note <strong>7</strong> as prime</li>
<li>see that 8-10 are marked and skip them</li>
<li>move to 11, note <strong>11</strong> as prime</li>
<li>move to 12, see that it is marked and skip it</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see it graphically with this visualization from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/6420e3488e509dce176a1e957ea07ff5.gif" alt="sieve animation, shows the numbers being marked visually"></p>
<h3>Python Implementation</h3>
<p>The Python implementation that I used makes some modifications to the classic version of the algorithm that lets it generate an indefinite number of primes while being memory efficient</p>

<p>This version of the algorithm keeps a running set of the relevant matches, and keeps only the ones it needs.  We can translate it more or less directly to JavaScript like this:</p>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Let’s break down what this is doing.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token function">generatePrimes</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p><code>generatePrimes</code> is a JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator">generator</a>.  Generators “generate” a series of values in a “just in time” fashion; they only calculate the next value when it is needed, making them an efficient solution for working with large or infinite series.  You specify a generator function by adding the <code>*</code> to the function declaration.  Generators then use the <code>yield</code> keyword rather than <code>return</code> to return their values, and can <code>yield</code> multiple times. After a generator yields, it pauses execution until it is asked for another value.  For our <code>generatePrimes</code> function, we are operating inside an infinite loop and will yield continuously without stopping<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> markedNotPrime <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    valueToCheck <span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>We’re using a plain object to keep track of our marked numbers, and using <code>valueToCheck</code> to keep track of where we are in iterating through numbers. As noted, we will iterate it forever if the generator continues to be called.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token operator">!</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>valueToCheck <span class="token keyword">in</span> markedNotPrime<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  <span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">//...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>As in the original algorithm, if we get to a number that isn’t marked, we know that it is a prime.  So we <code>yield</code> it, which pauses execution.  If the generator is queried again, when we resume execution we mark the prime squared as not-prime, and we do that by assigning it an array with the current prime value in it.  Using arrays for markers will make more sense in a moment. For now its worth noting that we only need to mark prime-squared as non-prime since every multiple below that is the current prime multiplied by a number less than it, which means it will already be covered, as we will see below.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Here’s the clever part of this implementation.  When we hit a number that is marked as not-prime, instead of just skipping it and moving on, we use some logic to keep our list of marked values small and memory efficient. This is also what allows us to get an infinite list of primes instead of settling for those under a particular value.  What we want to do is keep a list of all the primes that are factors of each marked number.  Then when we hit a number that is marked, we mark the next multiple for each prime (<code>valueToCheck + prime</code>), and remove the current value from the object.  That keeps checks fairly cheap by eliminating the number of marked numbers, and allows us to only add values to the marked list as we need them.</p>
<p>We can then use this code to get the 1,000,001st prime like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> gen <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">generatePrimes</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    gen<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">next</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>gen<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">next</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>value<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>That executed on my laptop in ~20seconds, approximately the same as the python implementation in python2, a little slower than running it under python3.  I was curious whether using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map">Map</a> for our marked prime list would speed things up:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Thanksgiving this week, instead of a list of writing from around the web, this week I’ll be linking to some of my favorite lesser known software tools, apps and gear.  These are things that let me get things done, and I’m thankful for that.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Libraries</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> - I’ve written and spoken about Gatsby before, but it keeps getting better as a tool for building React-based web sites and applications.  This blog is written using it.</p>
<p><a href="https://date-fns.org/">date-fns</a> - date-fns is a nice modular lightweight alternative to <a href="https://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> for date management in JavaScript.  Because JavaScript’s built in dates are weird and hard to work with, and not everybody needs all of the goodness moment provides.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a> - It’s been overshadowed by Redux, but MobX is a fantastic state management library for JavaScript libraries.  Since its an object oriented model that can be used in a variety of ways, it is easier to pull in incrementally</p>
<p><a href="https://glamorous.rocks/">glamorous</a> - My favorite CSS-in-JS library for React, it lets you write styles in a few different ways, which allows you to manage things in a very React-y way, without ever getting stuck with things you can’t do.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> - The best app I’ve ever used for OSX and iPhone</p>
<p><a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane</a> - If you like GMail’s web app (obviously not to everyone’s taste) Mailplane is a great way to use it as a native app on OSX.  I like it because it allows me to use both of my Gmail accounts side by side with their own notification settings and no risk of being lost in a sea of browser tabs.</p>
<h3>Gear</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rickshawbags.com/commuter-laptop-bag">Rickshaw Bagworks Commuter Bag</a> - I’ve had the 2.0 version of this bag for the past 4 years, and it has been an amazingly versatile and durable tool for transporting my laptops, notebooks and more.  Highly recommended.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015">Chromecast</a> - I have a Chromecast and a Chromecast audio, and they’re an amazing cheap way to turn TVs and speakers into “Smart devices” that you can control from your phone without having to pay for “smart devices” that probably won’t be kept up to date the way you’d want.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2zpBZcm">Backbeat Fit</a> - I’ve now ended up buying 4 pairs of these headphones for myself and others.  They’re fantastic versatile headphones that work great for exercise headphones but are good enough quality to use for other purposes.  I personally have trouble with ear-buds (they don’t stay in my ears), so the over-ear style of the fit is perfect for me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://2ality.com/2017/11/currying-in-js.html">Currying In JS | 2ality</a> - A nice round up of the different approaches for using currying (a functional programming concept) in JavaScript.  My favorite line: <em>“One of JavaScript’s best traits is how many different styles of programming it can accommodate.”</em> This is one of my favorite things about the language as well.</p>

<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/">Entering the Quantum Era—How Firefox got fast again and where it’s going to get faster | Lin Clark</a> - I’ve been using Firefox 57 as my primary browser this week and so far it is very very nice.  Other than a single Chrome-specific extension that I’m missing, and a few minor devtool annoyances, everything has worked great.  And it is blazing fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share">Introducing Visual Studio Live Share | Microsoft</a> and
<a href="https://blog.atom.io/2017/11/15/code-together-in-real-time-with-teletype-for-atom.html">Code together in real time with Teletype for Atom | Github</a>  - In what appears to be a crazy coincidence, both Atom and Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code announced new tools for collaborating with other developers on code, using a google docs-like experience.  Atom’s solution is available in beta today, and is a free WebRTC based peer-to-peer solution for editing code together, with the primary user sharing their active tab with anybody who has the uniqueID for your session.  It also includes open-sourcing a library that would let other editors implement its document protocol. Microsoft’s solution is more ambitious, supporting both Visual Studio and Visual Studio code, and allowing users access to a whole shared workspace.  It is just an announcement for now though, and it’s not clear if it is a peer to peer or centralized solution, nor whether it will have a cost associated with it.  Regardless, both solutions look amazingly cool.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a few times about the state of browser compatibility and the web platform over the years.  Over 4 years ago I <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2013/06/11/evergreen-browsers">linked to a post celebrating the rise of evergreen browsers</a>. Then 2 years ago I was one of several people stressing about <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2015/06/10/is-safari-being-left-behind/">whether Safari was going to hold the web back</a>.  It’s something I’ve followed closely because supporting many different subtly incompatible execution environments is one of the most unique and frustrating challenges of front-end development.  </p>
<p>The last few years have been really good for web compatibility with Microsoft dumping Internet Explorer in favor of the evergreen Edge, and <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> allowing JavaScript developers to write modern JS spec-compliant code and then have it transpiled back into something that runs in a wide variety of environments.  But fairly recently things have started to get even better.</p>
<p>For the web application I have spent my workdays building over the past 4 years, we target the <a href="http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+Chrome+versions%252C+last+2+Safari+versions%252C+last+2+Firefox+versions%252C+last+2+Edge+versions">last 2 versions of the major desktop browsers</a> (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  At the time of writing that means we target</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome 61 + 62</li>
<li>Edge 15 + 16</li>
<li>Firefox 55 + 56</li>
<li>Safari 10.1 + 11</li>
</ul>
<p>I get that for some of you this is a very lax browser support standard, and you’re still supporting IE9 or old Android versions.  For others you don’t care about browser compatibility at all and are just hacking demos on the newest Chrome.  But “last 2 versions” is a real world standard that I know plenty of teams target.  And it certainly is a reasonable target for new devs learning about JavaScript and the web.  So let’s look at what is natively supported in all targeted browsers if you use this standard today. Spoiler Alert: life is pretty good.</p>
<h3>Available Now</h3>
<h4>All of ES6 and ES2016, and almost all of ES2017</h4>
<p>If you’re distrustful of Babel and have been holding off on learning the new features that have transformed JavaScript over the past few years until they were “browser supported”, now is your time.  Other than shared memory and atomics (more on that below), every single feature from the recent updates to the ECMAScript spec is available in the last 2 versions of all 4 major browsers.</p>
<p>That includes core ES6 stuff like classes, destructuring, and arrow functions.  But also features that were just standardized this summer like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async functions</a>.</p>
<h4>Modern CSS</h4>
<p>Modern CSS specifications like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">CSS Grid</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables">CSS Variables</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports">CSS Feature Queries</a> are all fully supported in these browsers, making creating layouts especially much easier than it had been in the past.</p>
<h4>Promises and Fetch</h4>
<p>Promises have been mostly supported for a while, but they didn’t have native support in IE11, so some folks may still be polyfilling them.  With a last 2 versions standard, you not only don’t need to polyfill Promises, but also can drop any polyfills for the promise based fetch api as well (and use them with async-await natively!).</p>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p>So there is a ton of stuff that is available today for people targeting the last 2 versions of browsers.  But there is also a bunch of stuff that is almost there:</p>
<h4>Web Assembly and low level primitives</h4>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/">WebAssembly is now shipping in the latest version of every major browser</a>.  WebAssembly is a target bytecode for the web that can interop with JavaScript.  Essentially somebody can write C, C++ or Rust code and then compile it to WebAssembly, which runs natively in the browser, potentially much more performantly than equivalent JavaScript code.  The latest version of all browsers also support <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/01/shared-array-buffer.html">SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics</a>, low level APIs for exploring better parallelism support in JavaScript.  In short, it will soon be possible to create much more performant experiences in web browsers than is currently possible.</p>
<h4>WebRTC</h4>
<p>The latest versions of all browsers also support WebRTC, an API for peer to peer communication through browsers.  This potentially opens the door for all types of browser-based text/video chat and collaboration applications.</p>
<h4>Service Workers</h4>
<p><a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/">Service workers are getting close</a>.  They’re available in every browser but Safari now, and Safari is working on them.  If we get another big <code>x.1</code> release of Safari like last year, they could be available for early adopters across the board within the next 6 months.  </p>
<h3>The web is moving forward together</h3>
<p>It’s fun to see this level of unified activity across the web platform over the past 2 years.  In my 7+ years of front-end development, I’ve never seen a more compatible web than the one we can develop against today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started this new thing last week, <em>Friday Links</em>.  There’s a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/MwEtFrDwFWzXSRv13">feedback form</a> if you’re a regular reader and want to tell me what you think of it.  Otherwise, enjoy the links!</p>
<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p> <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-inside/slaying-a-ui-antipattern-in-react-64a3b98242c">Slaying a UI Antipattern in React – JavaScript Inside</a> - This is an interesting case study of how to work through an architectural problem using React.  I love seeing posts like this that take real world scenarios (I deal with this case of having data that might be in one of several loading states all the time), and identify re-usable patterns for solving them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2017/netflix-and-react/">Netflix functions without client-side React, and it’s a good thing - JakeArchibald.com</a> - A nice look at what Netflix’s experience removing client-side react from their landing page means and doesn’t mean.  I’m going to be really curious to see how the JS community gets better at enabling fast initial experiences while still having full rich interactivity when the users need it.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> - Prettier put out a new release this week and now supports Markdown as well as JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and GraphQL.  It has been my favorite new tool of 2017, solving a problem I didn’t know I had: the mental overhead of constantly reformatting my own code.  </p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2zvm12Z">The Pragmatic Programmer - Andy Hunt &#x26; Dave Thomas</a> - Not a new book at all, but I like to recommend it at every opportunity.  It’s my favorite resource on the practice of Software Engineering and well worth checking out if you’ve never read it.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21730870-economy-based-attention-easily-gamed-once-considered-boon-democracy-social-media">Once considered a boon to democracy, social media have started to look like its nemesis - The Economist</a> - This is a wide-ranging take on the downsides of social media with a focus on it’s deleterious effects on our political systems.  If you’re on social media and/or you care about the future of politics in your place of living, it is worth a read.  </p>]]></content:encoded>
