<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/nic67#desktop-pwas">New in Chrome 67  - Desktop PWAs | Google Developers</a></p>
<p>Google has a new process for bundling web apps as installable applications, this time based on the emerging Progressive Web App semi-standard<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  An interesting alternative approach for smaller applications that don’t need the full electron runtime, or education apps targeting Chromebooks</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ambv/black">black: The uncompromising Python code formatter | Github</a></p>
<p>This looks like a Python version of <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, and something I’d be interested in playing with.</p>
<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2018/05/29/jest-23-blazing-fast-delightful-testing.html">Jest 23 | Jest Blog</a></p>
<p>Jest just keeps getting better.  This release brings interactive snapshot updating, so that you can approve some changes and not others.  That’s a big UX improvement and reason enough to upgrade, but looks like there are some improved matchers and new customizability options for power users as well.  A solid release.</p>
<h3>Tech &#x26; Business</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422752/microsoft-github-acquisition-rumors">Microsoft has reportedly acquired Github | The Verge</a></p>
<p>Microsoft seems to be doing everything it can to earn back love and trust from developers.  Some of that has been by investing in new stuff like Visual Studio Code, some of it has been attitude, and then things like this are just buying somebody elses love.  But I think they’ve earned back enough good will at this point that most developers will be willing to give them a chance and not assume that this will automatically be a bad thing.  Which is a big change from 5 years ago.</p>

<p>It’s a little vague still to really be considered a standard, but Microsoft and Google at least are providing broad support for similar sounding things that they both call PWAs, and Mozilla and Apple have been supporting the underlying technology if not the branding as much.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Business &#x26; Technology</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/">Gatsby contributors form Gatsby Inc. | Gatsby Blog</a></p>
<p>This blog is built on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, and I’ve <a href="https://benmccormick.org/topics/gatsby">written</a> and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro">spoken</a> on it a few times in the past.  So I’m really excited to see what happens with the tech as it becomes a company, while continuing to be open source.  It will be really exciting to see where they take it from here, and I think they have a real chance to be successful, especially if they can get a foothold into the ecommerce world.</p>
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p><a href="http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-cult-of-the-root-cause/">The Cult of the Root Cause | Donald Reinertsen</a></p>
<p>A really nice short post on problem solving, and how the quest to find the root cause for an issue can sometimes be a distraction.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2sgXJoo">Unbroken | Laura Hillenbrand</a></p>
<p>I’ve fallen behind on my quest to read 30 books in a year, but this month I was able to read a fantastic book that multiple friends had recommended: Unbroken.  With the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7339792/">second movie</a> based on the book coming out this fall, you’ll probably start to hear about this book again.  It’s been around since 2010, but I didn’t read it when it was first popular, and now I wish I had.  It is an amazing story of human perseverence, surviving trauma, and ultimately grace.  It doesn’t oversimplify the human beings whose lives it chronicles, but still manages to shine on a light on the best and worst of the human condition.  Highly recommended.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://changelog.com/reactpodcast">The React Podcast | Michael Jackson</a></p>
<p>I listen to a decent amount of podcasts, but I’ve usually found it tough to get into programming podcasts.  Without visually being able to see code, they’re usually either ultra high level, or get hard to follow when going into the details.  The changelog family of podcasts has generally been my favorite though, and the new<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> React podcast has been consistently excellent over it’s first 9 episodes.  Worth a listen.</p>

<p>This is a crazy look at what I suspect will be the next step in static site performance stuff.  This blog does some of the cool stuff mentioned here (we prefetch links on the page thanks to Gatsby, and I use google analytics at build time to determine popular pages and populate the Most Read Articles list on the main page) but this is next level, using analytics to efficiently prefetch.  Excited to try it on the site.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>

<p>Ok so I’m pretty late on this one<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>, but Tom King’s <em>The Vision</em> is the best comic book I’ve read in years.  He’s got a <a href="https://amzn.to/2IwlMq1">pretty</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/2LcYQ0U">good</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lh3ZFd">run</a> going on Batman now as well, but this is a brilliant self-contained story that holds up as well as anything I’ve seen. Great art as well.</p>

            <guid>https://benmccormick.org/2018/05/14/mobx-state-machines-and-flags/</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I was listening to the <a href="https://changelog.com/reactpodcast">React Podcast</a>, specifically their <a href="https://changelog.com/reactpodcast/5">episode on State Machines</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/davidkpiano">David Khourshid</a>.  About 20 minutes into the podcast, there was a discussion on the benefits of using enums over flags to model the state of objects that can change across multiple dimensions.  It reminded me of one of the nice patterns that <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a> makes possible, and I thought I’d share it here.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>To set the stage here, the podcast discussion centered around modeling an async process like a promise. One possible way given was to use a mix of flags and if statements like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// loading object</span>
<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ExampleLoader</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function">constructor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

    <span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">//fetch data from server and return it here</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

    <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">try</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">let</span> data <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>e<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>using one of these objects might look like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>In the podcast David Khourshid criticized this as a haphazard way to manage state, that doesn’t show the whole picture.  Because we can’t easily see how the various flags combine, it’s tough to keep track of all possible states.  For instance, in the above example, did we really want to show the error state if we had an error, but have called <code>load()</code> again and both <code>hasError</code> and <code>isLoading</code> are now true?  Maybe that was the intention, but maybe that was just a state that was missed during the original construction of the program.  It’s hard to tell.  </p>
<p>As an alternative to full blown state machine modeling, David advocated for an easy first step of swapping out flags for enums.  In that case the code above might look like:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> STATES <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

  ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'error'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'loaded'</span>

      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>with usage like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">switch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADING<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>INITIAL<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show blank state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>We can see just from using an enum, we’ve cleared some ambiguity: now it is clear that we should be showing a loading state when we’re loading data, even if a previous load resulted in an error.  And we’ve also been forced to remember another state distinction that was missed originally, the difference between a successful load and the initial state before load is called.  This type of Enum-based approach is really helpful for modeling complex systems and especially async process state. But it’s not perfect.  While ENUMs are great for listing out every possible state, sometimes we just need to know if an object is in a particular state.  For instance, we might have a special help-prompt component that should only show if our data is in an error state, but is otherwise divorced from the details of the data.  In that case <code>loader.hasError</code> is simpler and  cleaner than <code>loader.state === STATES.ERROR</code>.  It’s a straight forward named expression that doesn’t require importing a constant from another file or matching up to a string value.  Enums add some verbosity and ceremony to code that can otherwise be very simple.  Fortunately MobX allows us to have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<h3>MobX</h3>
<p>MobX is a state management solution created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mweststrate">Michael Weststrate</a>.  It grew out of the React community but can be used with other frameworks or on it’s own.  One of its nicest features are its intelligently updated <a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/computed-decorator.html">computed properties</a>.  With MobX we can write our loader object like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>extendObservable<span class="token punctuation">,</span> computed<span class="token punctuation">,</span> action <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'mobx'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Now we have both our state enum, and we can check specific properties.  So both of the below examples work:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// ENUM example</span>
<span class="token keyword">switch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADING<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>INITIAL<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show blank state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//Flags example</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show help component</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>And because MobX takes care of the details of efficiently updating our flags based on state, we know everything will stay in sync and remain performant, without a bunch of ugly code to make sure of that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ever since I started using Gatsby to power this blog, I’ve wanted the ability to write markdown with React elements intermingled in it.  This looks like the first working version of that I’ve seen.  I’m excited to play with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat: A cat(1) clone with wings | David Peter</a></p>
<p>This looks like a really cool project, a “cat” clone with syntax highlighting and git line indicators.  Lot’s of cool stuff being written in Rust these days.</p>

<p>I originally saw this letter in an article on <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/">Stratechery</a>, (and that piece is also great).  It’s one of the best short pieces on business that I’ve ever read.  The Stratechery piece breaks down the idea of “divinely discontent customers”, which is an amazing image.  But the other advice about how to set and maintain high standards is even better.  Just great stuff, from the leader of one of the most important companies in the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript &#x26; The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/04/css-at-scale--linkedins-new-open-source-projects-take-on-stylesh">CSS at Scale: LinkedIn’s New Open Source Projects Take on Stylesheet Performance | LinkedIn Engineering</a></p>
<p>This is a cool new set of CSS tools from LinkedIn.  This looks most similar to CSS Modules/PostCSS to my eyes, with a focus on optimizing bundle size for both CSS and templates/components.  I’d be very interested in playing with it.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/23/strange-and-maddening-rules/">Strange and maddening rules | Joel Spoelsky</a></p>
<p>I’m continuing to enjoy Joel’s series on StackOverflow.  I’ve always been more sympathetic to their moderation strategy than some, so I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader whether the explanations presented here hold water, but definitely worth reading if you’ve ever tried contributing to StackOverflow and been frustrated.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@felixrieseberg/defeating-electron-e1464d075528">Defeating Electron | Felix Rieseberg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> doesn’t have the best reputation.  Any time an electron based app makes news on Hacker News, three quarters of the comments are bashing Electron and the companies that use it.  It’s been criticized recently and prominently on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/02/non_native_apps_threat_to_mac">Daring Fireball</a> and seems to generally be looked down on by “real” MacOS developers.  So I think this is a helpful response.  An Electron community member knocks down some straw-men (Electron doesn’t only exist because web developers don’t want to learn new things) and then lays out what would be needed to replace it.  </p>
<p>I think there’s an interesting tension here:  This post describes what would be needed to create a more compelling cross-platform solution from the point of view of companies and developers.  But the criticism has mostly been focused on the requirements of users, not companies.  Specifically that Electron apps tend to be slower/less-memory-efficient/less accessible/less attuned to platform specific conventions.  So companies are making the decisions that let them serve the most number of people, while evolving to meet their needs as quickly as possible, with as small cost as possible.  But they’re possibly limiting the top level quality they can achieve, and there is a possible social good being missed by the people excluded (those with lower performance machines or accessibility needs<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>A great interview on the massive potential for good or evil today’s tech products can have.  This does suggest that the problem is deeper than simply “engineers and designers behaving ethically” though.  You can get at Reddit’s issues by following the money.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript has had a weird reputation inversion over the past decade.  For years it was the stripped down toy language that could.  It didn’t have the features people wanted, and it did have the features they didn’t want, but it ran everywhere and it was easy to just start building things.  The last decade has shown that you can actually build some serious applications in JavaScript.  But it has also eaten away at the ability to start simple and try new things.  State of the art for JavaScript apps now involves compile steps, a long tooling chain, and a million choices for developers to make.  So the folks who are helping new developers get started have a few options for teaching JavaScript:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embrace The Complexity</strong> - Want to learn to write Web Apps?  Let’s just toss you into a boilerplate that’s using node, webpack, react, redux, redux-saga, react router, glamorous, eslint, prettier, npm scripts, lodash, and babel.  This is what production apps look like, so you might as well start learning in a realistic environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hide The Complexity</strong> - This is where we maybe use something like <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> to provide a sandboxed area where we may be using Babel/React/etc, but the user doesn’t have to configure or think about them too much.  My understanding is that <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> tries to go down this route to some extent as well.</li>
<li><strong>Discard The Complexity</strong> - Teach coding like it’s 2010 all over again!  This approach is to focus more on the JavaScript language as it’s implemented in the browser, using script tags without a build step, and maybe even an older/simpler library like jQuery to explain DOM concepts and CSS.  This approach can eventually evolve towards introducing more complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the past few years I’ve seen a blend of all of these approaches when I’ve looked at other folks’ beginner level resources.  It’s been hard to determine the best way to prepare new developers for the complexities of the development process. But good news, I think that era is finally coming to an end.</p>
<h3>The Ideal Intro</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, we’d be able to introduce new developers to the concepts that undergird modern web apps, and teach them syntax that is as up to date as possible without having to entangle them in the implementation details and distractions of production grade tools like Babel and Webpack.  So we want them to start out writing JavaScript code that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modular</li>
<li>Cross-environment</li>
<li>Modern (ES6+ syntax as appropriate)</li>
<li>Simple to start with</li>
</ol>
<p>The last 10 years of tool build up have been primarily focused on making it easy to achieve the first 3 goals in production (along with prioritizing other needs of large scale applications).  But production tooling is by nature less concerned with #4.  Fortunately native environments are starting to catch up on the first 3, and that means we can do better.  </p>
<h3>The New Hello World</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to frame an intro through the classic “hello world” program.  Our goals are to create a JavaScript function that can print “Hello World”, and then expand on that a bit.  And we want to teach this in a way that will still look familiar when our learners get themselves into a production JavaScript code base.  </p>
<h4>Bare Bones</h4>
<p>We might start with something super simple like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name-display<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script language-javascript">
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> displayArea <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getElementById</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'name-display'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      displayArea<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerHTML <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Hello World'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>That’s about as simple as a JavaScript hello world gets.  You can access it by opening the file directly from the file system in your browser, and it’s easy enough to edit the text and see changes on refresh.</p>
<p>But in 2018, we can do something cool next.  We want to be modular and separate concerns, so lets create a hello world module.  This is an opportunity to introduce functions and modules.  It introduces our only small tooling step: adding a simple web server.</p>
<h4>Hello Modules</h4>
<p>On OSX, it’s easy enough to set up a simple web server with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code>.  We can do that with our existing index.html and verify that we can now see it at <code>localhost:8080</code> in our browsers<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After that, we can start doing cool stuff, starting with creating a new module:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//hello.js</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> sayHello <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'World'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token template-string"><span class="token string">`Hello </span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>name<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This is our first function.  Depending on your audience, you may want to strip this down a bit and remove the default parameter, or spend some time explaining the different concepts in play here. But the focus can be on the concept of functions, as well as the ability to export them from a module.</p>
<p>Now we can update our index.js file to use the new function.  Assuming both files are in the same directory, that will look like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name-display<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">type</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>module<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script language-javascript">
      <span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>sayHello<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'./hello.js'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> displayArea <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getElementById</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'name-display'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      displayArea<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerHTML <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">sayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Now we have a hello world built on a foundation that can scale towards modern JavaScript environments.  We have modules and modern syntax, and the only difficult setup step has been a lightweight web server so far.  The rest is just script tags.  </p>
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>It’s easy enough now to take our module and turn it into something interactive:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>container<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span> Enter a Name and Hit The Button<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>input</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>change-name<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Say Hello<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This example introduces DOM events and let’s the user decide who to say hello to.  It also is a good jumping off point for further experimentation for a new dev.</p>
<h3>Crossing Environments</h3>
<p>Going from the browser to node, even though it is simpler in some ways, is always going to be a bigger jump for newcomers because of most people’s unfamiliarity with the command line, and the base hurdle of installing node itself.  But once we’re ready to move past browsers, our new hello world can be easily translated to node land.  The biggest hurdle is in the file names.  We will have to rename or copy <code>hello.js</code> to be named <code>hello.mjs</code> (Node’s way of differentiating between files using ES6 syntax).  After that, we can write a simple script to start out:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//node.mjs</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>sayHello<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'./hello.mjs'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>And then, as long as we’re on an up to date version of Node, we can run it with <code>node --experimental-modules node.mjs</code>.  And we will see our Hello World.</p>
<p>There are some annoyances for beginners here.  Node only recently added module support, and beginners must</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename their modules to the currently non-standard mjs ending</li>
<li>Have a recent version of Node (v8.5+)</li>
<li>add the experimental-modules flag and learn to ignore the warning it gives</li>
</ol>
<p>But overall it isn’t meaningfully harder than learning to use node has been in the past.</p>
<h3>Interactive Again</h3>
<p>We can make our node.js version accept a command line arg easily enough, along with more opportunities to learn about functions, arrays and conditionals.</p>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>I’m excited to see the new dev experience moving back closer to alignment with the production web app experience.  I think that can only be a positive things.  Some steps that will help even more if/when they happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Module file format standardization</strong> - The .mjs extension seems to still be controversial, but it also seems a bit inevitable.  So the question will be whether it becomes more standard to use across all modular JS on the browser and node.  The current split and experimental support makes for a confusing distraction for new learners</li>
<li><strong>De-flagging</strong> - Right now Firefox and Node still require flags for using modules.  That reduces beginner friendliness.</li>
<li><strong>Where is the jQuery of 2018</strong> - This is more speculative, but I think the next step to a beginner friendly hello world is a “beginner friendly framework” that is based on the “one way data flow/declarative translation of state to UI” paradigm that has swept across pretty much all modern JS frameworks.  That’s an important concept to understand, and there isn’t anything I’m aware of out there right now that let’s you build with those concepts but is as approachable to newcomers as jQuery is.  jQuery was a gateway to DOM manipulation, AJAX, and functional array manipulation for a generation of developers.  React and create-react-app is probably the closest to that concept today, but it isn’t nearly as simple.  </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now.  Code samples for this are <a href="https://github.com/benmccormick/hello-new">on github</a>.  Goodbye World.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>This should work in the latest Chrome, Safari and Edge out of the box.  I encountered a bit of slowness and flakiness on Chrome, but it worked like a charm in Safari.  Firefox still has this stuff behind a flag.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>
<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>
<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>
<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>
<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>
<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>
<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.  If you want a more practical and in the weeds design resource, then <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a> is probably a better bet.  But <a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> is still solid reading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The upcoming second edition of <a href="https://amzn.to/2IzhmhS">Refactoring</a> will have it’s code examples written in JavaScript.  I’d love to see more architecture-level books written for JavaScript developers.  I don’t think we have great definitive resources for those questions yet, and rewriting a classic with JS examples is a great first step.</p>
