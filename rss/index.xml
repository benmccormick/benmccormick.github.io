            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I was listening to the <a href="https://changelog.com/reactpodcast">React Podcast</a>, specifically their <a href="https://changelog.com/reactpodcast/5">episode on State Machines</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/davidkpiano">David Khourshid</a>.  About 20 minutes into the podcast, there was a discussion on the benefits of using enums over flags to model the state of objects that can change across multiple dimensions.  It reminded me of one of the nice patterns that <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a> makes possible, and I thought I’d share it here.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>To set the stage here, the podcast discussion centered around modeling an async process like a promise. One possible way given was to use a mix of flags and if statements like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// loading object</span>
<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ExampleLoader</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function">constructor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

    <span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">//fetch data from server and return it here</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

    <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">try</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">let</span> data <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>e<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>using one of these objects might look like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>isLoading<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>In the podcast David Khourshid criticized this as a haphazard way to manage state, that doesn’t show the whole picture.  Because we can’t easily see how the various flags combine, it’s tough to keep track of all possible states.  For instance, in the above example, did we really want to show the error state if we had an error, but have called <code>load()</code> again and both <code>hasError</code> and <code>isLoading</code> are now true?  Maybe that was the intention, but maybe that was just a state that was missed during the original construction of the program.  It’s hard to tell.  </p>
<p>As an alternative to full blown state machine modeling, David advocated for an easy first step of swapping out flags for enums.  In that case the code above might look like:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> STATES <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>with usage like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">switch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADING<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>INITIAL<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show blank state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>We can see just from using an enum, we’ve cleared some ambiguity: now it is clear that we should be showing a loading state when we’re loading data, even if a previous load resulted in an error.  And we’ve also been forced to remember another state distinction that was missed originally, the difference between a successful load and the initial state before load is called.  This type of Enum-based approach is really helpful for modeling complex systems and especially async process state. But it’s not perfect.  While ENUMs are great for listing out every possible state, sometimes we just need to know if an object is in a particular state.  For instance, we might have a special help-prompt component that should only show if our data is in an error state, but is otherwise divorced from the details of the data.  In that case <code>loader.hasError</code> is simpler and  cleaner than <code>loader.state === STATES.ERROR</code>.  It’s a straight forward named expression that doesn’t require importing a constant from another file or matching up to a string value.  Enums add some verbosity and ceremony to code that can otherwise be very simple.  Fortunately MobX allows us to have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<h3>MobX</h3>
<p>MobX is a state management solution created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mweststrate">Michael Weststrate</a>.  It grew out of the React community but can be used with other frameworks or on it’s own.  One of its nicest features are its intelligently updated <a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/computed-decorator.html">computed properties</a>.  With MobX we can write our loader object like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>extendObservable<span class="token punctuation">,</span> computed<span class="token punctuation">,</span> action <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'mobx'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  INITIAL<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'initial'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  LOADING<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'loading'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'error'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'loaded'</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token comment">// loading object</span>
<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">ExampleLoader</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function">constructor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

    <span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

    <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

      <span class="token keyword">try</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">updateState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>LOADING<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">let</span> data <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">fetchData</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">updateState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>LOADED<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Now we have both our state enum, and we can check specific properties.  So both of the below examples work:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// ENUM example</span>
<span class="token keyword">switch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>state<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>ERROR<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show error state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADING<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show loading state</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>LOADED<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show data State</span>
  <span class="token keyword">case</span> STATES<span class="token punctuation">.</span>INITIAL<span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show blank state</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//Flags example</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>loader<span class="token punctuation">.</span>hasError<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// show help component</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>And because MobX takes care of the details of efficiently updating our flags based on state, we know everything will stay in sync and remain performant, without a bunch of ugly code to make sure of that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ever since I started using Gatsby to power this blog, I’ve wanted the ability to write markdown with React elements intermingled in it.  This looks like the first working version of that I’ve seen.  I’m excited to play with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat: A cat(1) clone with wings | David Peter</a></p>
<p>This looks like a really cool project, a “cat” clone with syntax highlighting and git line indicators.  Lot’s of cool stuff being written in Rust these days.</p>

<p>I originally saw this letter in an article on <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/">Stratechery</a>, (and that piece is also great).  It’s one of the best short pieces on business that I’ve ever read.  The Stratechery piece breaks down the idea of “divinely discontent customers”, which is an amazing image.  But the other advice about how to set and maintain high standards is even better.  Just great stuff, from the leader of one of the most important companies in the world.</p>

<p>This is a cool new set of CSS tools from LinkedIn.  This looks most similar to CSS Modules/PostCSS to my eyes, with a focus on optimizing bundle size for both CSS and templates/components.  I’d be very interested in playing with it.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>

<p>I’m continuing to enjoy Joel’s series on StackOverflow.  I’ve always been more sympathetic to their moderation strategy than some, so I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader whether the explanations presented here hold water, but definitely worth reading if you’ve ever tried contributing to StackOverflow and been frustrated.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@felixrieseberg/defeating-electron-e1464d075528">Defeating Electron | Felix Rieseberg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> doesn’t have the best reputation.  Any time an electron based app makes news on Hacker News, three quarters of the comments are bashing Electron and the companies that use it.  It’s been criticized recently and prominently on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/02/non_native_apps_threat_to_mac">Daring Fireball</a> and seems to generally be looked down on by “real” MacOS developers.  So I think this is a helpful response.  An Electron community member knocks down some straw-men (Electron doesn’t only exist because web developers don’t want to learn new things) and then lays out what would be needed to replace it.  </p>
<p>I think there’s an interesting tension here:  This post describes what would be needed to create a more compelling cross-platform solution from the point of view of companies and developers.  But the criticism has mostly been focused on the requirements of users, not companies.  Specifically that Electron apps tend to be slower/less-memory-efficient/less accessible/less attuned to platform specific conventions.  So companies are making the decisions that let them serve the most number of people, while evolving to meet their needs as quickly as possible, with as small cost as possible.  But they’re possibly limiting the top level quality they can achieve, and there is a possible social good being missed by the people excluded (those with lower performance machines or accessibility needs<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript has had a weird reputation inversion over the past decade.  For years it was the stripped down toy language that could.  It didn’t have the features people wanted, and it did have the features they didn’t want, but it ran everywhere and it was easy to just start building things.  The last decade has shown that you can actually build some serious applications in JavaScript.  But it has also eaten away at the ability to start simple and try new things.  State of the art for JavaScript apps now involves compile steps, a long tooling chain, and a million choices for developers to make.  So the folks who are helping new developers get started have a few options for teaching JavaScript:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embrace The Complexity</strong> - Want to learn to write Web Apps?  Let’s just toss you into a boilerplate that’s using node, webpack, react, redux, redux-saga, react router, glamorous, eslint, prettier, npm scripts, lodash, and babel.  This is what production apps look like, so you might as well start learning in a realistic environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hide The Complexity</strong> - This is where we maybe use something like <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> to provide a sandboxed area where we may be using Babel/React/etc, but the user doesn’t have to configure or think about them too much.  My understanding is that <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> tries to go down this route to some extent as well.</li>
<li><strong>Discard The Complexity</strong> - Teach coding like it’s 2010 all over again!  This approach is to focus more on the JavaScript language as it’s implemented in the browser, using script tags without a build step, and maybe even an older/simpler library like jQuery to explain DOM concepts and CSS.  This approach can eventually evolve towards introducing more complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the past few years I’ve seen a blend of all of these approaches when I’ve looked at other folks’ beginner level resources.  It’s been hard to determine the best way to prepare new developers for the complexities of the development process. But good news, I think that era is finally coming to an end.</p>
<h3>The Ideal Intro</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, we’d be able to introduce new developers to the concepts that undergird modern web apps, and teach them syntax that is as up to date as possible without having to entangle them in the implementation details and distractions of production grade tools like Babel and Webpack.  So we want them to start out writing JavaScript code that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modular</li>
<li>Cross-environment</li>
<li>Modern (ES6+ syntax as appropriate)</li>
<li>Simple to start with</li>
</ol>
<p>The last 10 years of tool build up have been primarily focused on making it easy to achieve the first 3 goals in production (along with prioritizing other needs of large scale applications).  But production tooling is by nature less concerned with #4.  Fortunately native environments are starting to catch up on the first 3, and that means we can do better.  </p>
<h3>The New Hello World</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to frame an intro through the classic “hello world” program.  Our goals are to create a JavaScript function that can print “Hello World”, and then expand on that a bit.  And we want to teach this in a way that will still look familiar when our learners get themselves into a production JavaScript code base.  </p>
<h4>Bare Bones</h4>
<p>We might start with something super simple like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name-display<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script language-javascript">
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> displayArea <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getElementById</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'name-display'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      displayArea<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerHTML <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Hello World'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>That’s about as simple as a JavaScript hello world gets.  You can access it by opening the file directly from the file system in your browser, and it’s easy enough to edit the text and see changes on refresh.</p>
<p>But in 2018, we can do something cool next.  We want to be modular and separate concerns, so lets create a hello world module.  This is an opportunity to introduce functions and modules.  It introduces our only small tooling step: adding a simple web server.</p>
<h4>Hello Modules</h4>
<p>On OSX, it’s easy enough to set up a simple web server with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code>.  We can do that with our existing index.html and verify that we can now see it at <code>localhost:8080</code> in our browsers<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After that, we can start doing cool stuff, starting with creating a new module:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//hello.js</span>
<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token keyword">const</span> sayHello <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'World'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token template-string"><span class="token string">`Hello </span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>name<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This is our first function.  Depending on your audience, you may want to strip this down a bit and remove the default parameter, or spend some time explaining the different concepts in play here. But the focus can be on the concept of functions, as well as the ability to export them from a module.</p>
<p>Now we can update our index.js file to use the new function.  Assuming both files are in the same directory, that will look like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name-display<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">type</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>module<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token script language-javascript">
      <span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>sayHello<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'./hello.js'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> displayArea <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">getElementById</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'name-display'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      displayArea<span class="token punctuation">.</span>innerHTML <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">sayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Now we have a hello world built on a foundation that can scale towards modern JavaScript environments.  We have modules and modern syntax, and the only difficult setup step has been a lightweight web server so far.  The rest is just script tags.  </p>
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>It’s easy enough now to take our module and turn it into something interactive:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- index.html --></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>container<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">'</span>name-display<span class="token punctuation">'</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This example introduces DOM events and let’s the user decide who to say hello to.  It also is a good jumping off point for further experimentation for a new dev.</p>
<h3>Crossing Environments</h3>
<p>Going from the browser to node, even though it is simpler in some ways, is always going to be a bigger jump for newcomers because of most people’s unfamiliarity with the command line, and the base hurdle of installing node itself.  But once we’re ready to move past browsers, our new hello world can be easily translated to node land.  The biggest hurdle is in the file names.  We will have to rename or copy <code>hello.js</code> to be named <code>hello.mjs</code> (Node’s way of differentiating between files using ES6 syntax).  After that, we can write a simple script to start out:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//node.mjs</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>sayHello<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'./hello.mjs'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">sayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>And then, as long as we’re on an up to date version of Node, we can run it with <code>node --experimental-modules node.mjs</code>.  And we will see our Hello World.</p>
<p>There are some annoyances for beginners here.  Node only recently added module support, and beginners must</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename their modules to the currently non-standard mjs ending</li>
<li>Have a recent version of Node (v8.5+)</li>
<li>add the experimental-modules flag and learn to ignore the warning it gives</li>
</ol>
<p>But overall it isn’t meaningfully harder than learning to use node has been in the past.</p>
<h3>Interactive Again</h3>
<p>We can make our node.js version accept a command line arg easily enough, along with more opportunities to learn about functions, arrays and conditionals.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">//node.mjs</span>
<span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>sayHello<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">'./hello.mjs'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">getLast</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> list <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>list<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">return</span> list<span class="token punctuation">[</span>list<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length <span class="token operator">-</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
  <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">sayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">getLast</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>process<span class="token punctuation">.</span>argv<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>I’m excited to see the new dev experience moving back closer to alignment with the production web app experience.  I think that can only be a positive things.  Some steps that will help even more if/when they happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Module file format standardization</strong> - The .mjs extension seems to still be controversial, but it also seems a bit inevitable.  So the question will be whether it becomes more standard to use across all modular JS on the browser and node.  The current split and experimental support makes for a confusing distraction for new learners</li>
<li><strong>De-flagging</strong> - Right now Firefox and Node still require flags for using modules.  That reduces beginner friendliness.</li>
<li><strong>Where is the jQuery of 2018</strong> - This is more speculative, but I think the next step to a beginner friendly hello world is a “beginner friendly framework” that is based on the “one way data flow/declarative translation of state to UI” paradigm that has swept across pretty much all modern JS frameworks.  That’s an important concept to understand, and there isn’t anything I’m aware of out there right now that let’s you build with those concepts but is as approachable to newcomers as jQuery is.  jQuery was a gateway to DOM manipulation, AJAX, and functional array manipulation for a generation of developers.  React and create-react-app is probably the closest to that concept today, but it isn’t nearly as simple.  </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now.  Code samples for this are <a href="https://github.com/benmccormick/hello-new">on github</a>.  Goodbye World.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>
<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>
<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>
<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>
<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>
<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>
<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.  If you want a more practical and in the weeds design resource, then <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a> is probably a better bet.  But <a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> is still solid reading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second post in a series of posts on Computer Science basics for front end developers.  The goal is to focus on the practical implications of basic CS theory for JavaScript development.</em></p>
<p>Modern programmers owe a lot to the efforts of many head in the sky theoretical mathematicians from the 1800s and early 1900s who were searching for mathematical truths and ended up making discoveries that serve as the basis of many modern computing inventions.  Boolean Algebra is one of a few branches of mathematics that was developed for purely theoretical reasons that has ended up shaping the computer revolution.  It fortunately has the virtue of being a relatively approachable to mathematical newbies.</p>
<p>Boolean algebra is a study of operations on logical values. Or in more understandable language, it is studying the rules of logic when we’re limited to dealing with only 2 types of values, true or false.  The basic building blocks of boolean algebra are incredibly simple: in addition to the true and false values, usually encoded as 0 for false and 1 for true, boolean algebra considers 3 basic operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “AND” operator (<code>∧</code>)</strong> - <code>a∧b</code> is true if and only if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both true.</li>
<li><strong>The “OR” operator (<code>∨</code>)</strong> - <code>a∨b</code> is true if at least one of <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> are true and false otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>The “NOT” operator (<code>¬</code>)</strong> - <code>¬</code> is a unary operator. It only affects a single value.  <code>¬a</code> is true if <code>a</code> is false, and false if <code>a</code> is true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is a whole field of mathematics, so the interesting part comes as you start combining these pieces.  Mathematicians have discovered many “laws” that apply to boolean logic.  Some of these will probably look familiar to those of you who took high school algebra.  Here’s a sample of the laws from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>The last 3 especially are worth remembering.  Taking them out of mathematical notation for a second and using pseudocode instead, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Negation: <code>not not x == x</code></li>
<li>De Morgan 1 <code>(not x) and (not y) === not (x or y)</code></li>
<li>De Morgan 2 <code>(not x) or (not y) === not (x and y)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Boolean Algebra in JavaScript</h3>
<p>For most JavaScript developers, the preceding description of boolean algebra probably seemed suspiciously familiar.  It turns out that JavaScript has all the base units of boolean algebra in its core language.  True and false are represented by the appropriately named boolean primitives <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.  AND, OR, and NOT are represented by <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>!</code> respectively.</p>

<p>So a JavaScript statement like</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> y<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  <span class="token comment">// false</span>
  <span class="token function">willNeverHappen</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>is equivalent to <code>x∧y</code> in boolean algebra notation.  But this being JavaScript, there are some quirks and things to know about.  </p>
<p>First of all it’s worth noting that boolean logic in JavaScript is lazy by default.  That means that JavaScript will only evaluate enough of a boolean expression to know what the result will be.  So in an expression like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">alwaysReturnTrue</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">alwaysReturnFalse</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> value <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">alwaysReturnFalse</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">alwaysReturnTrue</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>the function <code>alwaysReturnTrue</code> will never be called.  This will matter when we start talking about real world takeaways.  </p>
<p>The second JavaScript quirk gets its own section.  Because booleans get more complicated when they interact with the rest of the JavaScript world.</p>
<h3>Truthy and Falsy</h3>
<p>When JavaScript conditionals like the if statement evaluate an expression, they aren’t strictly evaluating to see if something is the boolean values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.   Instead they’re looking to see if the expression is <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>.  This isn’t the kindergarten version of booleans, instead it’s JavaScript’s way of handling the fact that not all expressions are boolean.  Rather than requiring you to cast your values to boolean or use a statement that produces a boolean, JavaScript instead treats every value as either truthy or falsy.  The rules for this are reasonably consistent and easy to follow once you understand what is happening<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  It turns out that most values are truthy, so it is easiest to just learn the falsy values.  In JavaScript the falsy values are:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
undefined<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token number">NaN</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token string">''</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// or ""</span>
document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>all <span class="token comment">// Special case browser hack just for fun</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>If an expression that evaluates to one of these values is read into a boolean context like an if statement or ternary, it will be treated as false.  Any other value will be read as true.</p>
<h3>Implications and Hacks</h3>
<p>So far we’ve gone through some theory, as well as JavaScript’s own quirks.  But now let’s talk about 3 different implications of this stuff for day to day JavaScript programming.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Shortcuts using the  &#x26;&#x26; and || operators</strong> - It’s fairly common, especially in special context like minified code and JSX expressions in React, to run into code that get’s clever with the lazy behavior of JavaScript boolean operators.  Specifically the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> statement often get’s used as an inline if statement like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userID <span class="token operator">=</span> showID <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">getUserID</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>which is equivalent to</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userID<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>showID<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  userID <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">getUserID</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  userID <span class="token operator">=</span> showID<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">//presumably false or null</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>The <code>||</code> statement can be used for a similar purpose, usually to provide a fallback value.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">createNewUser</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>providedRole<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">let</span>  userRole <span class="token operator">=</span> providedRole <span class="token operator">||</span> <span class="token string">'basic-user'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token comment">//...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>It’s important to be careful with this type of use though, because if it would be valid for the user input to be a falsy value like <code>''</code>, <code>null</code> or <code>0</code>, this can introduce subtle bugs.  More on that in a second.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t personally relying too heavily on this technique.  Besides the possibility of subtle bugs, it isn’t very approachable for new developers, especially if you try nesting logic this way.  But you should know how it works since you will see it, especially in minified code you may need to debug and JSX.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>!! for casting</strong> - Another common idiom to be aware of is the use of double negation to cast values to a boolean.  It is fairly common when you have code that is expecting a boolean and not just a truthy/falsy value to convert the value to a boolean.  One way to do that is using the <code>Boolean</code> constructor, like <code>var bool = Boolean(value)</code>, but another method is to use double negation.  The first negation evaluates to the boolean that is opposite the truthy/falsy value, and the second one flips it back to the original truthy/falsy state, but as a boolean.</p>
<p>I personally find this notation to be less confusing than the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code>/<code>||</code> shortcuts, but your mileage may vary.  Either way, it’s important to understand its role since it is common to find <code>!!</code>s in real world code.</p>

<p><strong>0s and empty strings are dangerous</strong> - For our last quirk, let’s imagine a code example function <code>getCountFromServer</code>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> getUserCountFromServer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">try</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'users'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> users <span class="token operator">=</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
      <span class="token keyword">return</span> users<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">catch</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">e</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">// if we can't get the count, return null</span>
      <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This function makes a request from the server, and then returns the number of users, or <code>null</code> if it can’t get the value from the server for whatever reason.  Maybe not the best error handling, but certainly something you could see in real world code.  If we want to test to see if this function got data correctly, we have to be careful.  We might want to simplify our testing by taking advantage of <code>null</code>’s falsiness like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userCount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">getUserCountFromServer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>userCount<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something with the info</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">//handle the case where the number failed to load</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Do you see the bug?  It’s subtle.  With code written like this, if there are no users it will be treated the same as if the number had failed to load at all.  This is a pretty common bug in situations where a value might be undefined or null, but could also be a number.  Strings have a similar issue.  </p>
<p>It’s important to understand that if 0 or empty strings are a valid value for a variable, you can’t rely on a general falsiness check to see if the value is defined.  Instead it’s better to either define the exact falsy value you expect for “no value” (null in this case) or to check based on type.  For instance in this case, you could rewrite the code to look for a number:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userCount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">getUserCountFromServer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">typeof</span> userCount <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">'number'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something with the info</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">//handle the case where the number failed to load</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>TC39 and the future of JavaScript/ECMAScript</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/smooshgate">#SmooshGate FAQ  |  Mathias Bynens</a> - A great explanation both of the background behind the recent twitter controversy over <code>Array.prototype.smoosh</code> as well as the TC39 process generally.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zenparsing/js-classes-1.1">js-classes-1.1 | Allen Wirfs-Brock</a> - This is the new proposal for expanding JS classes I mentioned in my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/03/16/proposals-in-production/">post</a> last Friday.  It aims to be a more minimalist take on expanding class capabilities (primarily adding private state syntax) than other proposals that have come along over the last few years.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/wycats/b1c96c67074396a239abd60f55087adc">thoughts.md | Yehuda Katz</a> - This was a response to the JS Classes 1.1 proposal from Yehuda Katz, the lead proponent of adding decorator syntax for JavaScript classes.  He compares the new proposal to existing proposals, with specific concerns for how it would interop with decorators.</p>
<h3>Computer Science and Software Engineering</h3>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/basecs">basecs | Vaidehi Joshi</a> - While I’ve been starting to consider how to explain CS concepts for front end developers without a CS background, I found this excellent beginner set of CS articles written by Vaidehi Joshi on Medium over the past year.  Worth diving into, especially if you like fun visuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nrwl.io/the-3-skills-that-helped-me-become-a-better-software-engineer-8b06a37becf3">The 3 Skills That Helped Me Become a Better Software Engineer | Victor Savkin</a> - This is worth sharing solely for the advice about mental models.  In my experience the ability to think in abstractions (and understand when you need to dig deeper) is one of the biggest hurdles in programming when trying to grow from a beginner to a more advanced software engineer.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I’ve been working through a goal to read 30 books in a year, and have worked through a few more books recently.  Here are two good ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Gbh9R2">The Martian | Andy Weir</a> - Yes I know I’m 3 years late on this one.  But I’m sure there are other lost souls like me who entered 2018 without reading this book.  If you love tech and science (and I’m guessing you do if you’re reading this), you should find a way to read The Martian.  My first thought when I started reading it was “This is great”.  My second thought was “How in the world did this end up becoming a Hollywood Blockbuster starring Matt Damon?“.  The Martian is unapologetically geeky, and it is “real science” fiction, with a very human core. I loved it.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2G1h9ah">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a> - This was a recommendation from my manager, and is a great read for anyone who wants to improve the meetings they’re in at work.  It’s written in a “business fable” style, with a story serving to illustrate the principles it is trying to teach.  One thing I love is that it tells the story of the principles being implemented from a lower rung employee, rather than a top-down executive driven approach, so hopefully it can be inspirational to you even if you feel like you wouldn’t be able to change your meeting culture even if you knew what to do.</p>]]></content:encoded>
