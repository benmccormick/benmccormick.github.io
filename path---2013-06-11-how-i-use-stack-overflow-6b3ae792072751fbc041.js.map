Some of these problems resolve themselves quite easily.  A beginning Javascript programmer may not know that he needs to include a script in order to use the jQuery syntax he’s seen online, but he’ll discover it very quickly when his script fails to run.  But it’s quite possible to go on programming for years without realizing that it’s bad practice to couple your view and model too tightly, or even without gaining a deep understanding of how a web application model actually works. We create our models of how programming works, and it’s easy to stay inside those closed doors.  It can be easy to try and fit new languages into existing understandings, which is why you find people writing Java that looks like C and Javascript that looks like Java.  We don’t grow because we don’t ask the right questions.</p>\\n<h4>Enter Stack Overflow</h4>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The killer feature when asking questions is that developers often won’t answer within the scope of what you asked; they’ll help you ask the right questions instead</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If the problem is that we don’t ask the right questions, a Q&#x26;A site may seem like a dubious solution.  But <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/\\\">Stack Overflow</a> has been the best tool I’ve ever found for self-directed learning.

The most obvious way is allowing open-ended questions to be asked, with answers crowd-sourced from a global community of developers.  The killer feature when asking questions is that developers often won’t answer within the scope of what you asked; they’ll help you ask the right questions instead.  If you ask how to change the backgrounds of a group of DOM items given a list of ids, you’re likely to get an answer (or 5) while also helpfully being informed of the existence of classes.  Because multiple answers are allowed you may be exposed to multiple approaches. There is plenty to be learned this way.  Stack Overflow also helps automate this process by suggesting related questions as you type your questions, based on keywords.  The AI behind this is quite good, and usually causes me to abandon my question writing as I realize that my question has already been asked and answered.</p>\\n<h4>Learning</h4>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Questions asked by other people that you can’t answer are the best part of Stack Overflow</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Stack Overflow really began making a difference in my work and learning though when I moved past asking questions and also began contributing.  At the end of 2012 I started making a serious effort to begin answering questions, both as a way to contribute back to the community, and as a way of learning about my primary language at work, Javascript.  I was, and am, by no means a Javascript expert.  But I have learned a lot through the following process:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><em>Browsing regularly through new questions under the Javascript and Coffeescript tags.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><em>Picking out interesting  questions that haven’t been answered satisfactorily yet.
