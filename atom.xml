<p><a href="https://medium.com/blackrock-engineering/5-common-mistakes-with-keys-in-react-b86e82020052">Common Mistakes with Keys in React | Li He</a></p>
<p>This was a nice summary of a topic that lots of people likely breeze over in React until it burns them.  Short and informative; good stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/extracting-command-line-arguments-nodejs/">Extracting command line arguments from Node.js using destructuring |  Nicholas C. Zakas</a></p>
<p>Destructuring is one of those JavaScript featurs that it’s easy to go a little crazy with.  You go from not knowing it exists to writing expressions like this in a day<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="javascript">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>user<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>fname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userFirstName <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Jon'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> lname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userLastName<span class="token operator">=</span> 'Smith<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> data<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>That type of thing will drive the people reading your programs crazy eventually.  This article provides a nice example of where destructuring shines.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.attack-gecko.net/2018/09/04/followership/">Followership | Jason Wong</a></p>
<p>This is a really interesting breakdown of “follower styles”.  I’ll admit I’m a sucker for 2x2 grid frameworks, but I love em because they’re powerful communication tools.  I’ll be thinking about how I can use this with my team, as well as thinking about how I relate to those in authority over me.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>That sets 2 variables, <code class="language-text">userFirstName</code> and <code class="language-text">userLastName</code> pulling them from <code class="language-text">data.user.fname</code> and <code class="language-text">data.user.lname</code> respectively, and defaulting them to John and Smith if they’re not defined. …obviously?</p>

<p>A new Git tool from the makers of Sublime Text.  Looks lightning fast, good looking and usable.  Exactly what you’d expect.  I’m not a big UI guy for Git, but I’ll be playing with this, and it might be my new go-to recommendation.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OqjY8u">The Everything Store | Brad Stone</a></p>
<p>Still finishing this one up, but can already recommend it.  A great look into the creation of one of the most important companies in the world.  I was pretty interested to read about how intense Jeff Bezos is, and how hard he ran the early employees of Amazon.  I hadn’t realized that he fell into the Steve Job’s school of CEO-hood.</p>]]></content>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/">The Rise of Immer | Shawn Wang</a></p>
<p>I’m a few weeks late on this one, but it is worth your time.  Shawn breaks down a new trend in React state management: the increasing popularity of Immer as a base for improving state management APIs.  I’m particularly interested in <a href="https://github.com/aweary/react-copy-write">react-copy-write</a> as a new simpler paradigm for React state management.  Right now Redux has “won” that space, and MobX is the clear second option, but it still feels like there’s room for improvement and new options.  Will be cool to see what people build on top of immer.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-fail-as-a-new-engineering-manager-30b5fb617a">How to fail as a new engineering manager | Brad Armstrong</a></p>
<p>As a new engineering manager, I found this list super helpful.  I can already feel the temptation to fall into many of these traps, and it’s encouraging to hear about them from somebody who has gone ahead of me.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2xzyhho">Every Good Endeavor | Tim Keller</a></p>
<p>This is a “Christian book”, but I think it would be interesting to anyone who is interested in thinking about why we work, and how we find meaning in our work.  If you are a Christian, there’s lots of insight here connecting the truths of our faith to the rhythms of our work lives.  If you’re not, there is plenty to provoke thought, because the questions this book raises; why do we work? why is work often so unfulfilling? How do we find our purpose?; are universal questions regardless of whether you agree with Keller’s answers or foundational beliefs.  Highly recommended.</p>]]></content>

<p>This is a smart set of criteria to consider when looking at new tools.  I’d add that it’s always worth comparing a library to a “do it without the library” approach, to make sure you understand the benefits that you’re getting for your specific project.</p>

<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2xfflEi">Ready Player One | Ernest Cline</a></p>
<p>I’m about 7 years late on this (and even 6 months late for the movie hype), but Ready Player one was a great little sci-fi novel that uses 80’s pop culture as a background for a bunch of insightful commentary about our modern tech culture and where it may be heading.  A lot of fun, and worth reading if you’ve missed it for this long like me.</p>]]></content>

<h3>Books For Programmers</h3>
<p>It’s a bit of a slow week links wise, so this week I want to share some of my favorite “timeless” programming books.  These are books that will still be relevant in 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2wVjXyi">The Pragmatic Programmer | Andy Hunt &#x26; David Thomas</a></p>
<p>My favorite book on general programming “tactics”.  Lots of code level tips and tricks here, as well as some higher level architecture thinking.  Some of the specific examples have aged out, but the general concepts discussed in this book are timeless.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2mKoejo">Clean Architecture | Robert Martin</a></p>
<p>I reviewed this one <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/">earlier this year</a>, and it’s a relatively new book, but I’m confident that it is built to last.  This is a great book on programming “strategy”, the high level construction of maintainable programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NpJyK7">How To Win Friends And Influence People | Dale Carnegie</a></p>
<p>Not a programming book, but for most programmers who have achieved a minimal level of technical proficiency, the best thing they can do to get better in their career is not more technical growth, but instead growth on their “soft” skills.  Communicating complex topics, helping teams work well together, working through interpersonal issues, negotiation and persuasion are all huge skills for professional software developers.</p>
<p>There are lots of “business” books out there that are worthwhile, but this is the best book I’ve ever read on the simple yet endlessly deep topic of relating to our fellow human beings.  It has been relevant and helpful for 82 years, and I wouldn’t expect that to change soon.</p>]]></content>

<p>I’m in the middle of possibly switching to VSCode from Atom, which I switched to from Vim, which I switched to from Sublime Text, which originally introduced me to a world beyond overweight IDEs like Eclipse.  So I can relate to this article, and it’s a great framework for thinking through switches.  I will say, I don’t necessarily think I’ve made the best choices here.  I’m not sure that since I’ve learned Vim keybindings, any of my switches have actually increased my productivity.  There’s a cost to learning new tools, even when they have shiny new stuff. <em>grumbles a bit and then goes back to chasing the shiny</em>.</p>

        <updated>2018-08-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>How do we get better faster?</em>  It’s amazing to consider the amount of money, thought and effort that has gone into solving that one simple problem in software development over the past 2 decades.  Here’s a small sample of buzzwords, trends and methodology that are concerned with reducing the time between making a change to software and seeing the results:</p>
<p><strong>Agile -</strong> Agile is all about delivering working software sooner, so that you produce value faster and learn lessons quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD) -</strong> Test driven development is a process designed to let you know as soon as possible when a change has had the desired effect during development, and also sets up the conditions under which you know as soon as possible when a change has had an undesirable side effect.</p>
<p><strong>Devops -</strong> Devops has been a push over the past decade to automate and control all parts of the software creation, deployment and maintenance life cycle.  Automation like continuous integration servers that run your test after every commit, chat bots that alert you based on site performance metrics, and servers that automatically build a copy of every branch for testing in a virtual machine are all examples of Devops being used to speed up the point when you know that a change worked or didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Experience -</strong> This is a more recent buzzword that I’ve seen thrown around a lot in the JavaScript community, talking about improving developer tools.  Developer tool features like hot reloading, nicer error messages, specialized debugging and profiling tools, and fast build times all fight this same problem of getting a result as fast as possible.</p>
<h3>Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>All of these tools are concerned with <em>feedback loops</em>, the process by which developers, designers and product managers make changes, learn about the effect of those changes, and then iterate.  Teams with slow feedback loops spend a lot of time planning and thinking about every change, making sure to get everything right. They feel the cost distinctly each time they make a mistake, and it generally leads to a more cautious mindset.  Teams with fast feedback loops can plan too.  But they also have the option of taking a more experimental attitude and learning from their attempts. This can happen at multiple scales:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>developer</strong> can try out 5 different CSS rules in the UI in a few seconds if his UI is hot reloading and he doesn’t have to wait for a whole SCSS bundle to recompile</li>
<li>A <strong>QA team</strong> can immediately know if somebody pushes a change that would breaks tests if they have a CI server set up to run tests against every new commit to each branch.</li>
<li>A <strong>product team</strong> can see quickly that a new feature is problematic if he’s able to see detailed analytics on usage, instead of waiting to do enough user interviews to get a full picture</li>
<li>A <strong>company</strong> can change direction if they ship an MVP early instead of attempting to wait and release the perfect product</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing Your Loops</h3>
<p>As a developer who wants to make your product better, one of your best power moves is finding ways to speed up feedback loops.  Here are 4 suggestions for how to do that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask Questions Early:</strong> One of the most important feedback loops for a developer is between yourself and the individual in charge of defining what you’re building.  If you simply take requirements from your PM/Manager/Lead/Designer/CEO/Client and go off and build your giant amazing piece of beautiful software, without any clarification, there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get to build it again, this time twice as fast without the budget.  Asking clarifying questions early prevents you wasting your time and exposes understanding gaps and technical barriers while there’s still a chance to deal with them.</li>
<li><strong>Get Feedback as you go:</strong> Similarly, anytime you have a chance to get feedback on work while it is still in process from somebody who might object in the end, do it.  This means instead of building everything at once, work on smaller chunks.  This often takes time and thought, but the earlier you create <em>complete</em> chunks of code that can be evaluated and ideally shipped on their own, the more likely you are to ship something great in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your environment:</strong> Have you spent time figuring out how to work as efficiently as possible?  Have you done it recently?  If not it might be worth re-evaluating your setup on a quarterly basis or so, figuring out what tools you can use to get quicker feedback, and also learning the shortcuts, tricks and new features for the tools that you do use.</li>
<li><strong>Ship Code:</strong> Ultimately the best feedback comes when people are using what you’ve written.  Whether that’s compliments, bug reports, feature requests, anger or viral adoption, shipping will tell you things that you would never have been certain of while iterating on your own.  If you’re struggling to get code out, always fix that first.</li>

<p><a href="https://csswizardry.com/2018/07/getting-to-know-a-legacy-codebase/">Getting to Know a Legacy Codebase Harry Roberts</a></p>
<p>I like this advice on approaching a new codebase.  Some of it is CSS specific but the general ideas of tackling the important bits, experimenting with changes, and using tools as much as possible to catch regressions apply across the board.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/a-one-year-pwa-retrospective-f4a2f4129e05">A one year PWA retrospective | Zach Argyle</a></p>
<p>TL;DR: Pinterest saw great results from supplementing their mobile apps with a PWA web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/mission-improve-the-web-ecosystem-for-developers-3a8b55f46411">Mission: Improve the Web Ecosystem for Developers | Dion Almaer</a></p>
<p>I don’t know Dion, but this was a wonderful list of challenges that people looking to improve the web platform might want to tackle.  I’m excited to see people tackling this stuff.  I’m especially interested in what better tools for creating performant sites would look like.</p>
<h3>Technical Deep Dives</h3>
<p>These are long technical articles, and more back end focused then I usually write about on this blog but both touch on things I’m interested in and I found them fascinating.</p>
<p><a href="https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/">Centrifuge: a reliable system for delivering billions of events per day || Calvin French-Owen</a></p>
<p>I had to build an event handling system like this a few years ago, and it’s fun to see how the optimal solution changed for Segment as they scaled.  On the backend designs that make no sense for small projects start becoming very real options as a project scales.  That’s why it’s always worth having some skepticism over the idea that because AppAmaGooFaceSoft are using a technology it must be “best in class” and we should use it in our small 20 person development team that is facing problems of a completely different scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/">ripgrep is faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift} | Andrew Gallant</a></p>
<p>This piece is structured as a comparison of performance between cli file search tools, but the cool part is the deep insight into text search algorithms and performance tricks littered throughout the benchmark discussions.  It’s fascinating to see how heavily optimized for speed these tools are.  Also, I’ve been using Ack for 5 years even though I know it’s not the fastest tool for searching, because for me it was always “fast enough” to avoid searching.  But ripgrep appears to be dramatically enough faster in the relatively rare circumstances where I’m searching truly large directories of files, that I may finally be up for converting to a new tool.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2mPr3zV">Front-End Reactive Architectures | Luca Mezzalira</a></p>
<p>I’ve been very excited to check out this book since I first saw the title pre-release.  I finally had a chance to purchase and read it last month, and I’m sad to report that I had fallen prey to the classic mistake of judging a book by it’s cover.  I had hoped that this would be a deep dive into architecture and how we structure front end applications, and how reactive programming concepts can impact that.  There’s a real dearth of quality high level UI architecture resources out there, so I was genuinely excited about this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the book is structured more like a series of loosely related blog posts, first with an overview of older architectural models like MVC, MVP and MVVM, followed by sections looking at several different libraries that use reactive principles: RxJS, Cycle, and MobX.  The latter sections focused more on the nuts and bolts of using the libraries to create simple example apps and less on the impact that using them would have on a large application.  So this is a good book if you want to see some simple code examples of how these libraries work in practice.  But I’m still waiting for a great high level front-end architecture book.</p>]]></content>
