        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve read 2 things lately that really reminded me of the value of code reviews.  One was <a href="https://amzn.to/2Elk5g8">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout, which I reviewed <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/12/31/book-review-philosophy-of-software-design/">here</a>.  Philosophy of Software Design is a practical guide to software design, and Ousterhout emphasizes code reviews as the best point for “practicing architecture” in real world projects.  The 2nd was Sophie Alpert’s recent blog post <a href="https://sophiebits.com/2018/12/25/why-review-code.html">Why Review Code</a>, where she lists the various advantages she’s seen from having code reviews.  I can’t improve on her list, but I can endorse it.  I’ve seen all of the things she listed as benefits from code reviews in the past.  However I’ve seen these benefits come out in some environments more than others.  So I wanted to share 6 practical tips to getting the most valuable possible out of your team’s code reviews.</p>
<h4>1. Make sure that code reviews are multi-directional</h4>
<p>When you start doing code reviews, it can be tempting to only have senior developers review code.  After all, they’re the ones who know the system best. But not only do you risk burning out your senior staff that way, you also miss out on some of the biggest benefits of code reviews.  You get different benefits with different team combinations.  I’m using Junior and Senior here relatively speaking, the roles may change over time or in different areas of the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senior Reviewing Junior</strong> - This is the first thing most folks think about.  This is an opportunity for a more experienced developer to catch bugs in a less experienced developer’s code and also give suggestions for improving architecture-level structure, introducing new ways of doing things, or catching when there are opportunities for code consolidation that the original author might not have known about.</li>
<li><strong>Junior Reviewing Senior</strong> - When a less experienced developer reviews the code of a more experienced developer, its an opportunity for them to see new ways of doing things, and also get “cheap” exposure to new areas of a codebase.  It’s also a great opportunity for them to ask questions about things they don’t understand.  But it shouldn’t be a one way street.  Often times a fresh pair of eyes are great at catching bugs, and if a code review is particularly confusing to a less experienced dev, it’s a sign that the code may need to be rewritten or better documented so that it can be maintained in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Peer Reviewing Peer</strong> - When 2 developers have roughly equal skill and experience with the codebase, code reviews are still an opportunity for a second pair of eyes, but they also have the benefits of building team collective knowledge about the codebase and exposing times when there are differences in approach across the team.  Conversations at this level are a great place to standardize on best practices and team conventions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Hold reviewers responsible for the code they review</h4>
<p>If a bug makes it past initial development efforts and is caught by QA or ends up in production, who is responsible for it?  Although there will ideally always be layers of accountability here, most developers I know naturally tend to hold themselves responsible when code they wrote breaks something, but also apply the same standard to others.  This can lead to rubber-stamp code reviews when things get busy, since there’s no “skin in the game”.  The benefits of code review tend to come out though, when developers take that same responsibility for the code they review.  A team culture that sees the reviewer and the developer as equally responsible for maintainable code, bug-smashing, and other architecture concerns will lead to better code reviews.  This means treating code review as a core job responsibilities for devs and rewarding those who do it well, rather than just tacking it on.</p>
<h4>3. Match technology to your process</h4>
<p>The teams I’ve worked on that didn’t have real code review processes also didn’t have an easy setup to make it work.  They were reviewing diffs manually in their editors or over email.  Tools like Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab have made this much easier.  If you want this to be part of your process, make it as easy as possible.</p>
<h4>4. Use checklists where appropriate</h4>
<p>In moderation, I’ve found checklists a useful tool for code reviews.  If your team has specific areas of focus that you want to improve compliance on, it can be helpful to give reviewers a list of items to sign off on.  For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify change supports internationalization</li>
<li>Verify change doesn’t add any new code with legacy framework</li>
<li>If change is user-facing, verify it includes documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<p>You can take this too far, the review process shouldn’t be reduced to repetitive box-ticking.  But these can be great as guides for implementing new initiatives or addressing problem areas in code.</p>
<h4>5. Make code reviews as atomic as possible</h4>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10 lines of code = 10 issues.<br><br>500 lines of code = &quot;looks fine.&quot;<br><br>Code reviews.</p>&mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/397664295875805184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2013</a></blockquote>
<p>Huge code reviews are overwhelming, and much easier to rubber stamp.  When you develop a culture of creating small focused issues and reviewing each of them, it leads to more interaction and better results. Single issue (atomic) code reviews are best.  As a rule of thumb, if you can describe the change without using the words “and”, “rewrite”, or “a couple of different”, you’re probably doing alright.</p>
<h4>6. Leave space to make changes</h4>
<p>Finally, code reviews will have the most value if as a team you’re committed to acting on the feedback received.  That means being supportive when a code review leads to a re-write or refactor.  Sometimes that will need to be delayed of course, but in a healthy process there should usually be time to act on feedback.  This is of course easier if you’ve followed the previous suggestion and kept your code reviews small.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/01/07/the-concerns-of-fe-architecture/">
        </link>
        <updated>2019-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The word “architecture” gets thrown around a lot in software discussions.  But we don’t seem to always use it the same way.  Some example usages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our app uses Redux for our architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we assume that because we are using a framework or data management library, that must be our architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created a diagram of our dependency graph, showing all the imports in the code, as a way of seeing our architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could also say the way your program is structured (which files depend on which other files) represents your architecture.  If we’re fancy, then maybe we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML diagrams</a> representing this structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Bob is our architecture guy: he decides what dependencies we can bring in, is always asking us to refactor code to make it “cleaner”, and runs a design meeting before each feature to decide how to structure the code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final quote sounds like architecture is more about the decisions you’re making as you go through a project.</p>
<h3>Appealing to authority?</h3>
<p>So if the community isn’t using the term consistently, let’s ask the experts.  Here are 2 definitions from folks who have written popular books on software architecture.</p>
<p>Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) uses the following definition in <a href="https://amzn.to/2rROcEA">Clean Architecture</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin Fowler gave his definition in a talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DngAZyWMGR0">Making Architecture Matter</a>. It is worth watching in full, but paraphrased, his definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software architecture is those decisions which are both important and hard to change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These 2 definitions turn out to be complementary.  Uncle Bob motivates architecture: we’re focused on minimizing the work put into the system.  Martin Fowler’s definition shows what parts of the system architecture is concerned with: the parts that are “important” and hard to change.</p>
<p>The next question of course is… what is important?  The unsatisfactory answer is that it depends.  It will change between projects, and will change within a project over time.  But when we scope the question to the domain of front end development, common themes emerge.  Specifically there are 6 areas of concern that I see coming up again and again in public and private front end architecture discussions.  They’re not exclusive to the front end, but they’re a good starting point for anyone thinking about building web applications.</p>
<h4>Ease of Change</h4>
<p>When new requirements arrive, how quickly are developers able to make changes and release new code to production?  When there are bugs, how easy is it to find the problem and fix it?  Are developers able to consistently deliver correct code?  Or are multiple iterations often required?</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Can a malicious user inject code into your site?  Are you unnecessarily exposing information about your users or code structure? And you are working with your API developers to use secure authentication and authorization practices right?</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>This concern is broader than the way the word is often used in web dev circles.  Is the full audience of this site or application able to use it with as few limitations as possible?  Users with disabilities?  Users with older but supported browsers?  How about international users or those with slow connections?  Does your site work on mobile?  Offline?  On Apple Watch?  Do you support AMP? And do your pages appear nicely on social media?  Do you even care about any of these audiences? Maybe you’re optimizing for people who aren’t your users?</p>
<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>Is a site or  application consistently available to users?  Does it often fail, and if so how does it recover?  If things are breaking, are the developers aware of it quickly?  Do different users in different scenarios receive a consistent experience?</p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>Is a site or application consistently quick to load and interact with?  If there are animations or highly interactive elements, are they responsive and usable, or do they freeze/jank? Is the user disrupted in their tasks by strange loading behavior?</p>
<h4>Capability</h4>
<p>Is your site limited in fulfilling its purpose because of foundational decisions or tradeoffs with the other concerns?  Have you made decisions that let you serve your audience in unique ways because of your tech stack or development processes?  Do your technical decisions even make sense in the context of your site or application’s purpose?</p>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p>I’m hoping to look at each of these areas more in depth in the coming weeks, as well as exploring how we make decisions that impact multiple areas simultaneously.  In the meantime, as you’re looking at decisions and tools that will impact the long term structure of your front end application, consider how they’ll impact each of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture is about decisions that are important and hard to change, with a goal of improving the efficiency of a project</strong></li>
<li><strong>Front End architecture is often concerned with the areas of Ease of Change, Security, Accessibility, Reliability, Performance and Capability</strong></li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read a non-fiction book that you just couldn’t put down because you kept hitting paragraph after paragraph of useful, practical wisdom?  That was me reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2SABeXz">Radical Candor</a> by Kim Scott this summer.  It’s a ~200 page masterpiece on communication, leadership and being real at work.  The ideas in Radical Candor have already been a huge help to me as I’ve transitioned into a manager role over the past few months, and I fully expect to refer back to them a lot in the years to come.  It was the best thing I read in 2018, so I wanted to write a quick review to start the new year.</p>
<p>Radical Candor is split into 2 parts: part 1 is philosophical, and builds out a philosophy of working with and managing people that’s based on honest guidance and feedback backed by genuine care.  The second half of the book is tactical and focused on techniques that managers can use to implement the philosophical ideas.  Overall it is a book for managers, but is also relevant and useful for anyone who has a manager or who wants to work better with others in a professional setting.</p>

<p>The heart of the book is the 2x2 grid diagram that Scott sprinkles throughout the chapters, showing the 4 quadrants that can characterize an interaction, relationship or communication style.  People who don’t care about those they work with and also don’t challenge them fall into manipulative insincerity and should be avoided at all costs.  The Steve Jobsian category of Obnoxious Aggression is when somebody is willing to challenge directly but doesn’t care about the people they’re challengin. To Scott’s mind, Obnoxious Aggression is preferred over Ruinous Empathy; when people who hate the idea of hurting somebody so much that they fail to tell them important truths.  But the target quadrant is Radical Candor, a state where you deal with people in a way that is backed by real humanity while still being willing to be exceptionally honest and challenging.</p>
<p>This core idea wasn’t super new to me, I had seen it formulated in Church contexts as <code class="language-text">Grace + Truth = Growth</code> in the past.  But Scott puts in the work to show how these ideas play out in a wide variety of professional situations and relationships, and her examples left me teeming with new ideas on how to interact better with my coworkers.  The theme is good, but the implementation ideas and little nuggets of wisdom and experience sprinkled throughout are better.  As a result, Radical Candor is one of the best books on relationship and communication I have ever read.</p>
<p>I would recommend it for anyone who</p>
<ol>
<li>Manages people</li>
<li>Wants to manage people</li>
<li>Has a manager</li>
<li>Has to deal with people</li>
</ol>
<p>Do yourself a favor and check it out.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2018-12-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of the software books out there these days are marching towards their expiration dates the day they’re written.  When I see titles like “Angular 2 Development”, “Learning JavaScript with React”, “Writing Native Apps with Ionic 2 and Lodash 4” I know that the book will soon have out of date code examples and will not contain the latest ways a community is using the libraries they’re discussing.  There is value in these types of books and they often represent a monumental amount of thought and time from their authors, but 5 years from now they will no longer be relevant.  I love reading books that I know will last.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Rpu6zX">A Philosophy Of Software Design</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout">John Ousterhout</a> is a book that will last.  It’s full of timeless software writing advice that isn’t tied to a particular language, library or point of time.  Although not formally organized this way, it seems to be divided into ~4 parts: 2 chapters on the idea of complexity, a concept which Ousterhout uses as the unifying theme of the book, 8 chapters on what I’d describe as the structural design of software systems, 7 chapters on more “code level concerns” like naming conventions, comments and making code obvious, and then a final 2 chapters that feel a bit more like appendixes which discuss some common software trends and designing for performance.</p>
<p>The best part of the book is those first few chapters where Ousterhout eloquently describes the problems that complexity can cause in a software project and lays out the distinction between a tactical and strategic approach to coding.  This is the heart of the titular <strong>philosophy</strong> of Software Design: the idea that software engineering is ultimately a fight against complexity.  It’s a strong vision clearly articulated.</p>
<p>The “structural” sections of the book are all sound in an opinionated way.  The book makes an argument for larger implementations hidden behind smaller abstractions, which Ousterhout calls “deep modules”, and much of the structural section is through that lens.  This isn’t as open-minded as architecture advice I’ve seen elsewhere, but the benefit is that it’s prescriptiveness makes it much easier to use as a guide or code review tool than more situational or caveated advice.  That practical aspect is clearly a goal of the book, and the approach therefore makes sense.</p>
<p>After chapter 11, the book takes a sudden detour from higher level concepts into much more concrete realms.  There is an extensive treatment of commenting style, naming conventions and other ways to make code readable and obvious.  There is a coherent through-line of building maintainable systems throughout, but the transition felt strange.  The content is still good though.</p>
<p>The book ends on a chapter addressing modern software trends through the lens of the concepts considered in the book, which felt like a good place to wrap up, and then a chapter on designing for performance.  Given the books focus on complexity and the size of the performance topic, this chapter is content to argue that simple designs are friendly to performance, without trying to unpack many performance related topics.  It felt a bit tacked on to me, but it makes sense as a piece of objection handling for those who feel that they can’t simplify their architecture for performance reasons.</p>
<p><em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is going to be my new go to recommendation for developers who are able to write code that runs but want to start thinking about how to write better code.  It doesn’t have the depth of something like <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/14/book-review-clean-architecture/">Clean Architecture</a>, but it is extremely readable and approachable, and I’ve never seen an architecture-level book that was so focused on actionable advice.  If you take the advice in the first chapter and consult the book during code reviews, every chapter in the book has something to consider when looking at a piece of non-trivial code.  That makes it a perfect introduction to higher-level software design thinking.  If you think that would be a fit for you, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rpu6zX">go ahead and check it out</a>.</p>]]></content>

For the first 9 months of the year, I posted a Weekly Links post every week, and also published 24 normal articles, before taking a break the last 3 months to deal with some changes in work and home life.  My employer went through an acquisition this year and I started working with a new team. Then Claire and I welcomed our first daughter, Elena, to the world earlier this month.  It’s been a busy but rewarding year.</p>

<p>I’m excited to get back to the blog in 2019, and take what I’ve learned the last few years and make some improvements I’ve been considering for a while.  The biggest one is shifting to a newsletter format for initially publishing my posts.</p>
<h2>Newsletter</h2>
<p>Over the last year, email newsletters have become my favorite ways to stay up to date in my professional world.  High quality newsletters from people like <a href="https://buttondown.email/kentcdodds">Kent</a>, <a href="https://larahogan.me/sign-up/">Lara</a>, and <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/weekly">Ponyfoo</a> are some of the best ways to both keep up with what’s going on tech and trends, but also learn new ideas in a blog post, way.  It’s a better forum for thoughtful content than social media, allows for communication between the writer and their audience.</p>
<p>I’ve always allowed people to subscribe to this blog through email, but to be honest, the experience has been kind of crappy.  I’ve meant to improve my email template forever, and articles sometimes got jumbled into a single email.  Going forward, they’re going to be a first class citizen, and the best way to follow the blog.  I’ll publish articles there first, and include extra “weekly link” like content in the emails only.  I’m switching emails over to <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> and they should be much cleaner and content focused going forward.  If you follow this blog through email, you’re probably reading this post in that format now.  If not, please go ahead and <a href="https://benmccormick.org/subscribe/">subscribe</a>.  I’ll be starting the year with a series of posts about front end architecture.</p>
<h2>2018 Roundup</h2>
<h3>Most Read Posts Published in 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/07/react-confessions/">React Architecture Confessions</a> React unquestioningly has a learning curve.  I decided to talk through the various mistakes I’d made as I learned React on the fly while building a large web application.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/07/04/evil-javascript/">Evil JavaScript</a> This was something different for me, a tongue-in-cheek look at the ways you can use and abuse some of JavaScript’s more powerful features</p>

<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2018</h3>
<p>With all the changes, it hasn’t been a big year for experimentation, but Immer is fantastic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mweststrate/immer">Immer</a> This probably deserves a full post at some point, but I’ve been experimenting with using only Immer and React’s built in state features for state management on a new project, and it’s been fairly nice so far.  It’s a lovely little library that makes working with immutable data pleasant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> My other big experiment on the new project has been using Storybook as a collaboration tool for our UI components.  It’s still early days, but I’m liking it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2018</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, lodash, MobX, Jest, Immer, CSS Modules</p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2019</h3>
<p>I want to try building some small hardware projects and automating them this year.  Something completely different.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to a plethora of life events happening this year, I’m going to be putting the blog on pause for a while.  So no more updates through the end of the year.  Will re-evaluate then and hopefully start things back up.  I have plans to take the weekly links stuff I’ve been doing the past year and turn it into a real email newsletter with a better template, and some exciting ideas for a new blog series.  But I lack the capacity to follow up on them for now.  So Happy Holidays in advance everybody, I hope to be back early next year.</p>]]></content>

<p>This was a nice summary of a topic that lots of people likely breeze over in React until it burns them.  Short and informative; good stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/extracting-command-line-arguments-nodejs/">Extracting command line arguments from Node.js using destructuring |  Nicholas C. Zakas</a></p>
<p>Destructuring is one of those JavaScript featurs that it’s easy to go a little crazy with.  You go from not knowing it exists to writing expressions like this in a day<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="javascript">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>user<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>fname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userFirstName <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Jon'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> lname<span class="token punctuation">:</span>userLastName<span class="token operator">=</span> 'Smith<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> data<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>

<p>This is a really interesting breakdown of “follower styles”.  I’ll admit I’m a sucker for 2x2 grid frameworks, but I love em because they’re powerful communication tools.  I’ll be thinking about how I can use this with my team, as well as thinking about how I relate to those in authority over me.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>That sets 2 variables, <code class="language-text">userFirstName</code> and <code class="language-text">userLastName</code> pulling them from <code class="language-text">data.user.fname</code> and <code class="language-text">data.user.lname</code> respectively, and defaulting them to John and Smith if they’re not defined. …obviously?</p>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/principles-of-component-api-prop-design-bb20cd58da54">Principles of Component API Design | Chris Schmitz</a></p>
<p>Good advice for designing React components</p>
<h3>Programming Tools</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a></p>
<p>A new Git tool from the makers of Sublime Text.  Looks lightning fast, good looking and usable.  Exactly what you’d expect.  I’m not a big UI guy for Git, but I’ll be playing with this, and it might be my new go-to recommendation.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OqjY8u">The Everything Store | Brad Stone</a></p>
<p>Still finishing this one up, but can already recommend it.  A great look into the creation of one of the most important companies in the world.  I was pretty interested to read about how intense Jeff Bezos is, and how hard he ran the early employees of Amazon.  I hadn’t realized that he fell into the Steve Job’s school of CEO-hood.</p>]]></content>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/">The Rise of Immer | Shawn Wang</a></p>
<p>I’m a few weeks late on this one, but it is worth your time.  Shawn breaks down a new trend in React state management: the increasing popularity of Immer as a base for improving state management APIs.  I’m particularly interested in <a href="https://github.com/aweary/react-copy-write">react-copy-write</a> as a new simpler paradigm for React state management.  Right now Redux has “won” that space, and MobX is the clear second option, but it still feels like there’s room for improvement and new options.  Will be cool to see what people build on top of immer.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-fail-as-a-new-engineering-manager-30b5fb617a">How to fail as a new engineering manager | Brad Armstrong</a></p>
<p>As a new engineering manager, I found this list super helpful.  I can already feel the temptation to fall into many of these traps, and it’s encouraging to hear about them from somebody who has gone ahead of me.</p>
<h3>Book Review</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2xzyhho">Every Good Endeavor | Tim Keller</a></p>
<p>This is a “Christian book”, but I think it would be interesting to anyone who is interested in thinking about why we work, and how we find meaning in our work.  If you are a Christian, there’s lots of insight here connecting the truths of our faith to the rhythms of our work lives.  If you’re not, there is plenty to provoke thought, because the questions this book raises; why do we work? why is work often so unfulfilling? How do we find our purpose?; are universal questions regardless of whether you agree with Keller’s answers or foundational beliefs.  Highly recommended.</p>]]></content>
