        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2mKoejo">Clean Architecture</a> by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin was one of the better books on Software Development I’ve read in recent years.  It did exactly what I want from a software book in 2018: it tackled an important high level topic with a great amount of depth in a way that helped me as a reader to develop insight and perspective on the topic.  These days blog posts and other online sources cover most of my “how to” needs, as well as the simple “what is X and why should I care about it” questions that I used to go to books for.  But there is still no substitute for books when you want an in depth understanding of an important broad topic.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1516226851&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+architecture&linkCode=li2&tag=benmccormicko-20&linkId=c599845decc4e5ed1457acae2a375ad6" target="_blank">
<img border="0" class="inline-img" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0134494164&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=benmccormicko-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=benmccormicko-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0134494164" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">
For this book, that topic is software architecture.  The book tackles it by starting with some history, and then starting with a micro view before expanding out its gaze.  After giving a broad overview of the different software paradigms, Martin walks readers through 3 levels of architecture principles: class-level design principles, component-level component principles and system-level architecture principles.  At each level he shows the similarities between the lower level principles, as well as the unique concerns at each scale. Then he wraps it up with a case study example that shows the principles discussed throughout the book in action.</p>
<p>I found Clean Architecture to be a great reminder of concepts I learned in school<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> that I didn’t properly appreciate at the time due to a lack of practical experience.  It brought home to me that while there are some architectural things I do pretty well right now, like keeping code separated enough that it only has one reason to change, there are other things that I don’t do well a lot of the time.  For me the biggest realization was how much grief I’ve caused myself the last few years from failing to keep high level policies from depending on low level details.  The book gave me a few new lenses to examine my decisions with, and definitely inspired me to spend more time taking a step back to see the big picture as I’m adding new features.  </p>
<p>For me, that sense of perspective was the biggest win, but if you’re looking for detailed “how tos”, there’s a decent amount of that as well.  Martin goes into details about how to arrange and refactor classes to create maintainable systems that are easy to change, as well as identifying patterns to look for that may be a sign of problems to come.  He goes pretty deep into the weeds with examples and class diagrams as he discusses creating proper system boundaries and pulls it all together with a nice case study example at the end.  </p>
<p>While I did find Clean Architecture extremely helpful overall, I do have some nitpicks.  The biggest for me personally is that while the book mentions dynamic languages like Ruby and Python a few times, it mostly does so in passing to say that the principles mention still apply, but may look different.  Since this is usually not expanded upon, and all of the examples given seem to assume static languages that provide abstract interfaces to classes, it is sometimes hard to see how the books principles should be applied to the dynamic languages that I use daily.  I would love to have seen more detail there.  Also, the final chapter of the book “The Missing Chapter” was a bit of an oddity.  It was written by a different author<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>, framed issues that had already been covered differently, and came to some different conclusions than the rest of the book.  It was almost a counterpoint to the other parts of the book, which could have been interesting, but lacked an introduction or context to help explain its purpose.  Overall it left me a bit confused and ended the book on a discordant note rather than bringing the ideas together and focusing me on the important ideas.</p>
<p>I can recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2mKoejo">Clean Architecture</a> for anyone who wants to get better at thinking about the big picture when it comes to software systems, particularly if you haven’t already been exposed to any of the theory behind designing maintainable systems.  If you’re usually working in static languages on larger projects, I would double that recommendation, as you’ll be right in the book’s wheelhouse.  For those like me working with dynamic languages on web projects, it may be a bit more hit or miss, but it still is a great way to broaden your horizons and gain some new ways of thinking about the tradeoffs our work entails.</p>

It makes building an online editor that does shiny “text editor” things like linting, find and replace, syntax highlighting and autocomplete a very manageable endeavor.  It’s highly extendable and is a nice example of “easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible”, with simple addons for basic stuff, and less simple extension points for custom work.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been reading through <a href="http://amzn.to/2mKoejo">Clean Architecture</a> by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin this month<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, and while it is great it has had the unpleasant effect of reminding me of all of the mistakes I’ve made over the past few years while learning and using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.  I’ve absolutely loved using React at work, and it has made so many things easier.  But it’s a very unopinionated tool when it comes to structuring applications, and I made a lot of mistakes as I was using it to build some small side projects, and then transitioned a major production app to React from Backbone/Marionette.  These mistakes are all architectural; how I broke out components, communicated between components, and managed data and dependencies within components.</p>
<p>I thought it would be useful to lay out the architecture mistakes I made as I was learning React, both as a solid reflection exercise for myself, and a warning to those of you who are just starting down the “component based UI” road.  </p>
<h3>My Mistakes</h3>
<h4>1. Including API calls directly in components</h4>
<p><strong>What I did wrong</strong>: This is an embarrassing one, but essentially in several places I had components directly fetching data from the server in their constructors or mount calls, and using that information to determine what to render.</p>
<p><strong>Why I did it</strong>: This was to some extent a lack of planning.  I had all my core “business objects” modeled in some sort of separate object oriented way (either as Backbone or MobX objects) and was able to coordinate syncing them to the server outside of the component layer.  But some data in the system hadn’t been modeled in that way, and when I encountered a need for those components (such as some types of system configurations) instead of stepping back and coming up with a design for modeling those configurations on the front end, I instead sometimes fell back to an ad-hoc API call.   This was also sometimes a result of lazily copying legacy code that had bad patterns while converting components to React, and other developers copying bad patterns when trying to figure out the new React code.</p>
<p><strong>What I should have done instead</strong>: This could be a whole series of blog posts in itself, but essentially I should have been observing a few principles that would have set off alarm bells.</p>
<ol>
<li>Components in a system of any size shouldn’t know about the server. UI Components are about as “low level detail” as it gets in a UI architecture, and should be passed the data they need from a higher level portion of the system.</li>
<li>If the front end code needs data from the server, it is worth the time to properly model that data in terms of whatever data layer the front end is using.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. Breaking the “props as the component interface” abstraction</h4>
<p><strong>What I did wrong</strong>: One of the best things about React is the clear interfaces components provide with their list of props.  If properly documented with PropTypes or a type system like Flow or Typescript, it’s easy to look at any React component and tell what data it expects to receive, and therefore how other code is expected to interact with it.  99% of the time, good React components act as a function of <code>(props, state) => UI</code>.  It is however, possible to get access to a component instance, and call functions on them.  There are  rare situations where this is the right way to do things, for instance <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28889826/react-set-focus-on-input-after-render">focusing an input</a>.  </p>
<p>When I first started creating React components though, I overused that pattern, and accessed the interface directly to access or change its internal state.  I’d have components like this:</p>

      </div>
<p>that I would access from parent container like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">InputUser</span>

  <span class="token function">methodThatGotCalledOnSomeEvent</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p><strong>Why I did it</strong>:  Early on I was using this pattern in a way that copied other frameworks I was familiar with.  A parent component would need the state of it’s child component, so it would maintain a reference to the child and query the child about the state.  When I converted Backbone components to React, sometimes I was basically just copy and pasting existing code, and making it work.  </p>
<p><strong>What I should have done instead</strong>:  React doesn’t really encourage parents pulling state from their children.  Instead, if there is state that needs to be shared between components, it should be moved up to the parent component and then the state and an updater function should be passed down to the child component.  So my example above would look like this:</p>

<h4>3. Interacting with 3rd party components directly</h4>
<p><strong>What I did wrong</strong>: My first year and a half using React, when I was using 3rd party UI components like <a href="https://github.com/facebookarchive/fixed-data-table">react-fixed-data-table</a> I would always use them directly in my components, and take full advantage of their APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Why I did it</strong>: Because every React library in the world has documentation showing how to use its components directly in code for a variety of different use cases, and nobody ever tells you to put an abstraction around their code</p>
<p><strong>What I should have done instead</strong>: I should have wrapped the 3rd party libraries in one or more wrapper components.  This has a few advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we’re using a UI component like a table in a new place in our App, if I’ve created a wrapper component that has presets for most common settings, I only need to configure the things that are meaningful to this new use case in my app</li>
<li>Targeted wrapper components like a <code>SortableTable</code> component or a <code>DropdownWithAutoComplete</code> component are easy to understand to a new reader of the code.  Instead of digging through configuration props, they can read the component name and understand the purpose of that component then focus on the data being passed to it</li>
<li>When making updates to a library it is much easier to test that the changes are safe if the uses of the library are limited to a few focused components, rather than being spread across a whole application</li>
<li>Similarly, if we need to switch to a new library, that is much easier with a limited footprint</li>
<li>It can be easier to create reliable automatic tests using a wrapper component, since you have more control of things like how mocking works and when the component interface changes than you do for 3rd party code</li>
</ol>
<h4>4. Importing other parts of the system directly into display components</h4>
<p><strong>What I did wrong</strong>: The main application I work on uses a messaging system to allow communication between different parts of the system.  It’s a legacy piece from when it existed as a Backbone application, and isn’t a very React-y way of doing things, but that isn’t really a problem.  This situation would be the same for a logging component or a data store.  What isn’t great is that when I need to use the messaging system, I always import it directly into the component file.</p>
<p><strong>Why I did it</strong>: Direct imports are convenient, the messaging system is a core part of my system, and it seemed like a normal way of accessing it.  I also wasn’t aware of any better way to do it.</p>
<p><strong>What I should have done instead</strong>:  The disadvantage of direct imports is that they’re harder to test.  If I had passed my messaging system as a prop to whatever component needed it, it would be much easier to test that it was called in the way I expected, without having to mock out the whole messaging system library.  I also could abstract away the whole power of the messaging system, and only provide the specific functionality needed by a component.  When I first began working on this system though, I didn’t know a practical way to do this.  The messenger system was often used by deeply nested components, and it seemed bad to pass it down a whole component tree.</p>
<p>The answer is to use the <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-provider-pattern-context/">Provider pattern</a>.  The provider pattern is a way to use React’s context API to provide top level properties from a high level parent component to deeply nested child components.  It is a perfect pattern for providing important high level pieces of your application to low level components without tightly coupling them, while maintaining testability.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
<h4>5. Changing too many things at once</h4>
<p><strong>What I did wrong</strong>: When my team began converting our application from Backbone to React, it was tempting to try and change many things at once.  All the React examples you see online are using Babel/ES6, Webpack, Redux, React Router and tons of other shiny but complicated things.  Trying to implement it all in an existing project<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> can be overwhelming and lead to <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-lava-layer-anti-pattern.html">lava layers</a>.  We actually started out with good discipline and converted files to use ES6 first, then added Webpack, then slowly started to convert UI components to React.  Unfortunately as we continued to convert React, we began replacing our Backbone data models with MobX, and began using CSS Modules in some places.  When our team size was reduced last year, we were left in a situation where the same functions were performed in different ways throughout the codebase.</p>
<p><strong>Why I did it</strong>: It’s easy to see things that could be better in a web application and immediately want to fix them!  Especially if parts of that change seem easier than other changes you’re working on</p>
<p><strong>What I should have done instead</strong>: I wrote about this <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/">at length</a> last month, but there really is no substitute for taking things one at a time.  While it’s tempting to think that it will be easier to convert to React if you’re using other “react-y” tools and libraries, your code will ultimately be more maintainable if it is consistent throughout an application.  The only reliable way to do that is to make changes completely before you start making other changes.  It isn’t sexy, and it will leave you at least a little ways off the bleeding edge, but it’s the way to build large, reliable systems and keep them up to date.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/">The Brutal Lifecycle of JavaScript Frameworks | Stack Overflow Blog</a> - This was an interesting analysis on how JavaScript frameworks have risen and fallen.  Among the reasons that it’s interesting is that the data appears to be a bit of a Rorschach test.  The post itself is very negative about the pace of change in the JavaScript framework world.  But I saw a lot of twitter takes like this one:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This “new framework every 6-months” FUD is comical. The crux is centered on 4 JS frameworks released over the last decade. <br><br>4. In 10 years. <br><br>It’s great for my business, but makes me chuckle. <br><br>It’s not really moving that fast y’all. <a href="https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V">https://t.co/BiH7UK0M9V</a></p>&mdash; Joel ⛈ (@jhooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/951924735654244352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>Personally I lean more toward the side that there’s nothing wrong here.  The change in frameworks has come during a large change in use cases and technology used on the web.  Think PWAs verse server-side generated sites, and the large amount of new browser APIs and JavaScript language features.  These things have naturally brought new best practices which have been encoded in frameworks.  While it is true that a jQuery based site from 2009 might be difficult to maintain through today, that has less to do with the lack of support for the technology than it does with the fundamental nature of web development.  It would be much more difficult to build and scale a web application like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> using only jQuery and other 2009 technologies.<br>
Which is why it was surpassed for <em>web application</em> development first by a wave of frameworks that allowed you to model domain concepts in an object oriented way and tie that to a UI (Backbone, Angular1, Knockout), and then by a second wave that allowed you to do that with more declarative component-based UIs (React, Ember, Angular2+, Vue).  Those evolutions have come to match a real need.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48270127/can-a-1-a-2-a-3-ever-evaluate-to-true/48274520#48274520">Can (a ==1 &#x26;&#x26; a== 2 &#x26;&#x26; a==3) ever evaluate to true? | Stack Overflow</a> - This was a fun little question.  I don’t think I like it as an interview question for JavaScript, since it borders on trivia, and requires in-depth knowledge of the “bad parts” of JavaScript like <code>==</code> and <code>with</code> or global variable behavior that many new developers are just taught to avoid.  But it’s definitely a fun trivia question.  And it may even be a good interview question in Python, where you can do it using more commonly accepted parts of the language.</p>

        <updated>2018-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year I’ve been acting as the lone JavaScript resource working on a codebase with around 90k lines of JavaScript code.  That has left me spending the vast majority of my work time trying to knock out features and deal with bugs across the large code surface area.  But I’ve also wanted to do my best to continue to improve code quality with limited resources.  Here are a few things I’ve learned about trying to improve code quality across a large project with limited resources.</p>
<h4>1. You need to accept not being on the bleeding edge</h4>
<p>Let’s be real, in the JavaScript world the only way to always be on the bleeding edge is to never maintain an application for more than a few weeks.  And even in other contexts, it often is much less feasible than hype bubbles at conferences or sites like Hacker News might make it seem.  Most companies that are shipping software that users actually pay for are using quite a lot of very old technology quite extensively.  That’s not to say there’s no place for new and shiny things, but there will always be limits to how new and shiny things get.  When you’re low on people resources for the size of your project, those limits get a lot more restrictive.</p>
<h4>2. It’s important to identify your pain points.</h4>
<p>There are 3 main type of value that developers can add by changing a software system. They can write new <strong>features</strong>, which give users new capabilities.  They can improve some <strong>cross-feature attributes</strong> of the system like loading speed, accessibility, design, logging or documentation.  Or they can make <strong>architecture improvements</strong> that make it easier to make other changes.  Generally engineers don’t have to argue to add features, because the business decision makers will be calling for them constantly.  Cross-feature things like performance, design or logging sometimes come from business decision makers, but often only when things have become problematic, and then the conversations around how long it will take to achieve improvements can be tense ones.  Architecture concerns pretty much never come from business folks, because they usually don’t see the effects of a bad architecture until it is too late and shipping simple features has become a disastrously slow process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  It’s part of a developer’s job to push for the latter 2 type of changes when they’re needed.   But with limited resources, <em>needed</em> is often hard to quantify.</p>
<p>That’s why it is important to know what is <em>actually</em> causing you pain, or will soon be causing pain.  Is your site getting slower and slower?  Is your CSS a giant tangled mess that creates bugs with every change<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>?  Make a list, and then prioritize it by importance and expected effort.</p>
<h4>3. Take things one at a time</h4>
<p>Once you have a list of things that you want to fix, it can be tempting to try to fit those fixes in all over the places.  You’re creating a new page, might as well write it in Vue instead of Angular.  You’re changing some styles, maybe you can use a CSS in JS library.  But the absolute worst thing you can do with limited resources is try to improve too many things at once.  You’ll end up with a codebase with many different ways to do everything, so that every change requires a full context reset, and maintenance means dealing with multiple sets of bugs and compatibility issues for each duplicated approach.  That’s why prioritization is critical.  With limited bandwidth, you need to know what <strong>one thing</strong> will be the best use of your time.</p>
<h4>4. Expand from small footholds, don’t boil the ocean</h4>
<p>A few truths to note at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Changing large systems is hard.</strong>  They have a million different subtle assumptions weaved into their code, and making seemingly the same change in different places can often produce subtly different results.  </li>
<li><strong>Practice is how you learn to use a tool or technique optimally.</strong> Unless you’ve already used a technology extensively in a different context, you will never be more blind to it’s downsides than at the start of adding it to a project.  As you begin using it, you’ll learn more about it and how to use it better in your system.</li>
<li><strong>Well designed systems have good interface points</strong>.  Interface points are areas where one part of the system doesn’t need to care about the details of how other parts of the system are implemented, they just need to know the <em>interface</em> for interacting with that part of the system.  For example, when using React, parent components don’t need to know the details of how a child component work, just what props they take.  Similarly when writing HTMl, you don’t need to know the details of how CSS will work for layout, you just need to expose meaningful class names that CSS can use.  A website doesn’t need to know what language a web server is written in to make HTML requests to it.  These are examples of interface points, and while well designed systems will have more of them and fewer “breaches” of the interface lines, all systems have them to some extent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The implication of these truths is that there is value in starting small and expanding.  If we can pick a small section of the application that is cordoned off from the rest of the code in a meaningful way, we can create a foothold for the new technology.  This serves as a learning opportunity, an example, and a starting place.  If it goes badly, small changes are easy to revert or fix.  If it works well, we can look for more similar interface boundaries, or expand out to convert some of the code that uses the new code.</p>
<p>When I converted a large Backbone app to use React, I took advantage of 2 different interface boundaries.  I started by converting small “widget” components to be written in React, and came up with a method of calling these widgets from within Backbone code.  Once I had enough of these building block widgets written in React, I started writing new pages in React.  Then finally I would convert subsections of Backbone driven pages to React, starting from the bottom up and converting the top level layouts of the page last.  I was using 2 interface boundaries: components and pages.  That made sense for Backbone to React, where I was essentially converting one type of component tree to another.  But the lines may be different for other changes, and you’ll need to use your judgement.</p>
<h4>5. Automate what you can</h4>
<p>Not every change needs to be hard and slow.  Sometimes we can take advantage of automation. Tools like <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> and <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> make it easy to automate code style and correctness fixes.  Tools like React often provide <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod">codemods</a> to help make it easier to update to a new version of the tool or use best practices.  Unit tests can help you prevent regression bugs and are easy to automate with a CI server or <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/">pre-commit hooks</a>.  </p>
<p>If you’re dealing with problems that are more specific to your codebase, it may make sense to invest time into writing your own automation scripts, whether that means hacking together a crazy bash/python script to do a massive find and replace, or using a tool like Ansible to automate some previously manual developer processes. It made a big difference in our company when our QA developer put in the work to automate the creation of consistent local environments.</p>
<h4>6. Count the cost of maintenance</h4>
<p>With a small team, some improvements may simply not be worth it over time.  Genuinely valuable things like test coverage, JSDoc style automated documentation, old browser support, add overhead to future changes as well as any up front cost to implement. These are the type of things that advocates tend to moralize about, and say that it’s the developers job to advocate for them.  And that is true as I alluded to earlier.  But when faced with limited resources, it’s important to prioritize, and understanding the cost of maintaining certain improvements is part of that.</p>
<h4>7. Distinguish between craftsmanship and business needs</h4>
<p>Along the same lines, as developers we’re often encouraged to think of ourselves as craftsmen.  Think of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/">Steve Jobs talking about using good wood for the back of a cabinet</a> or the aforementioned moralizing about code and process quality.  There are great things about this, since it is a developers job to look after the quality and craftsmanship of their product.  But it also is good to align that craftsmanship with business needs and create something that is useful rather than merely theoretically beautiful.  So there is a place for making changes to improve the “purity” of code, but when investing limited resources, it’s even more important than usual to balance that with business needs.</p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2017/12/27/browser-bar-url-facebook-bad/">Stop Using Facebook and Start Using Your Browser | Foster Kamer</a> - This is a call for people to get out of their social media bubble and <em>internet like it’s 2005</em>.  Use bookmarks, type in URLs directly, basically go to sites directly for content instead of relying on social media algorithms to find stuff for you.  I think this is easier said than done.  Social networking sites are ingrained into our culture at this point. You don’t replace culture by condemning it, and telling everyone to go without but by creating something new or better<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.  So what can we make as Internet users that provides something as easy or easier than the mindless serendipity of social media, but produces better outcomes?  </p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2017 was the 5th full year of this blog, and in many ways it was the most productive.  I wrote one of the most popular things I’ve written on here, started the weekly links section (on hiatus for New Years, but will return next week), and wrote 21 full articles and 8 weekly links post, the most I’ve ever posted here in a year.  Here are some of the highlights from my blog and development this year.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I think there’s a hunger out there for clearer roadmaps for folks who are early out in their front end development career.  People are telling them to learn all the frameworks, all the tools and all the compile-to-JS languages, and everyone knows they can’t learn it all.  So even an imperfect list that can serve as a starting point for figuring that out can get some traction.  This article was my attempt to answer “what should a serious mid-level JavaScript developer have learned and be learning?“.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">How To Follow The JavaScript Roadmap</a> - This post was aimed at a similar audience to the “Serious JavaScript Developer” post, but aimed to help folks who want to follow changes in the JavaScript language keep up with new developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/03/orthogonality-and-css-in-js/">Orthogonality and CSS in JS</a> - This article was an examination of the architecture tradeoffs of CSS in JS solutions, and also an examination of how people discuss “separations of concerns” in general.  If you liked this one, keep your eyes open.  I’m planning on writing more architecture level posts in 2018.</p>

<h3>Code I wrote in 2017</h3>
<p>Most of the code I wrote this year was again for my work at Windsor Circle.  But I’ve continued to add new features to this blog, which is based on React and Gatsby, and the source code for that is available <a href="https://github.com/benmccormick/benmccormickorg">on Github</a>.</p>
<h3>Talks I gave in 2017</h3>
<p>This was a big speaking year for me.  I gave 3 different talks: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/vim-survival-guide-71763917">The Vim Survival Guide</a> at Open Source 101, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/gatsby-intro">Intro to Gatsby</a> at a local meetup group and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BenMcCormick/saving-time-by-testing-with-jest">Saving Time with Jest</a> at All Things Open.  I’d be interested in giving any of those talks again next year, so if you’re looking for a speaker, feel free to reach out.</p>
<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Technologies I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">Mobx</a> is a JavaScript data modeling library that serves as an alternative to Redux or React state for state management.  I wrote about my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/01/09/mobx-first-impressions/">first impressions</a> at the beginning of the year, but I’ve continued to use it and love it since then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a> was a nice upgrade over npm.  My understanding is that npm has since stepped up and closed the gap here, but I’m continuing to use Yarn for now since it has taken over my projects and muscle memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I upgraded this blog to Gatsby 1.0, I had the opportunity to learn about <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>.  I’ve really enjoyed getting to play with it and love the GraphQL community’s dedication to providing a great developer experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I used (more or less) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>JavaScript (ES6), Python, React, PostgreSQL, Backbone (<strong>sigh</strong>), lodash, MobX, Jest</p>
<h3>Languages and Libraries I want to try in 2018</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory">Victory</a>, Rust, and Pandas/other python data analysis libraries <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Blogs I started following in 2017</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/">Mark Erikson’s Dev blog</a></p>
<h3>Blogs I read every post from in 2017</h3>
<p><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a>, <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://purposedworking.org/">purposedworking.org</a>, <a href="https://wynnnetherland.com/">wynnnetherland.com</a></p>
<h3>Podcasts I started listening to in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theallusionist.org/">The Allusionist</a> - A great podcast on the crazy history behind different words in the English language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I started using in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> - I mentioned I was testing this out at the end of last year, but it has become my go-to notes application, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a stylish notes app in the middle ground between Apple Notes and Evernote (and who uses Apple products).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software I used (nearly) every day in 2017</h3>
<p>MacOS/iOS, Google Search, Chrome/Safari/Firefox, GMail/MailPlane 3, Twitter/Tweetbot, Feedbin/Reeder, Instapaper, iMessage, Slack, Trello, 1Password, Atom/Vim, iTerm, Fish Shell, Bitbucket, Fantastical, Spotify, Bear, Annotate, Dash</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Yes this is basically the same list as last year.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mostly learn tech as I have need for it, and it was a very “nose to the grindstone” year focused on improving existing codebases this year</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>JavaScript And The Web</h3>
<p><a href="http://raganwald.com/2017/12/14/73939133.html">73,939,133 / Truncatable Primes | Reg Braithwaite</a> - A nice writeup about how brute force can be useful in solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> style math problem.</p>
<h3>Programming Tools and Practices</h3>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/12/18/jest-22.html">Jest 22: Refinements &#x26; Custom Runners | Jest Blog</a> - This looks like a solid refinement release for Jest.  One warning: If you’re running <code>jest -o</code> on precommit hooks as I described <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/02/26/running-jest-tests-before-each-git-commit/">here</a>, Jest 22 fails when run with 0 tests, so you need to specify the <code>--passWithNoTests</code> flag in order to let things go when you make a change that doesn’t affect any tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-12-20-introducing-the-gatsby-ux-research-program/">Introducing The Gatsby UX Research Program | Gatsby Blog</a> - An unusual case of doing real UX research for an open source developer tool.  Very cool stuff.</p>
<h3>Non-Tech</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat">Google Maps’s Moat</a> - If you have any interest in product design, maps, or computer intelligence, this is the one article you need to read this week.  Beautifully put together.  It’s an in depth examination of the difference between Google and Apple maps, but it reads as a deeper exploration of how big data combined with computer learning and automation can have a huge impact on product design.</p>
