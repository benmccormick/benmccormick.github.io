        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been working through a goal of reading 30 books in a year.  I made a list sourced from books that I’d wanted to read in a while, and books that friends recommended, and I’ve been working through it.  For the most part I’ve gotten through books pretty quickly as they’ve been generally fascinating.  Last month was the first time I hit a book that I struggled to get through a bit.  Fortunately I stuck with it, and it was worth it in the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> by Alan Cooper is a book that I’d seen recommended all over the place by design-savvy developers and product folk.  Cooper is the creator of Visual Basic, a highly regarded programmer who became an even more high regarded designer, pioneering the field of interaction design (laid out in his other book <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>) and the use of personas in software design.  While <em>About Face</em> is his explanation of the techniques behind interaction design, <em>The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</em> is his case for why interaction design is necessary as part of the software development process.  As somebody who has been working in a partial design role for the past year, it seemed like a great fit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first few chapters were a struggle.  The first 4 chapters of the book are devoted to laying out the poor “current situation” for technology when the book was written in the late 90s.  Cooper goes through a long list of poor experiences in devices and software like TVs, email clients, car remotes, alarm clocks and more.  The problem is that almost universally his examples are out of date.  People certainly still write software with bad UX, and struggle especially with software that is replacing hardware.  But they struggle in different ways now than they did 15 years ago.  Possibly due to the influence of the author, and partially due to some maturation in the field and changes in technology, the particular examples listed in these chapters fail to land. It’s possible to extrapolate some things to present day, but it makes for choppy reading.  At minimum the book would benefit greatly from a second edition.</p>
<p>A second issue that made the book harder to apply was also related to the publish date.  This is a book that is firmly rooted in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a>/long release cycle view of the software development process. In fact if anything it is advocating for a more waterfall-like approach than the waterfall status quo of 2004.  I’m genuinely curious how the author would choose to communicate his critiques today in light of the normalization of agile techniques.</p>
<p>If I haven’t scared you off yet, you’re at the same place I was 4 chapters in, wondering if I should cut my losses and give up on a great but outdated work.  Fortunately I stuck with it and reaped the benefits. The last 10 chapters are as relevant as ever in todays world.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 describes the complementary roles of design, engineering, and business acumen in successful businesses.  Chapters 6-8 make the case for interaction designers being a distinct field that can’t easily be filled by industrial designers, visual designers, marketers or programmers. There is a particular focus on the problems of developers designing the code that they’re implementing.  Chapters 9-11 are a high level view of the principals of interaction design.  Finally chapters 12-14 describe what implementing design into a software culture looks like.  There is a ton of great content in these chapters.</p>
<p>As a programmer who has been designing and implementing for the last year, the critiques of chapters 6-8 rang quite true.  I see all the tendencies outlined in the book dragging me away from user-focused design, and it’s a constant battle to remind myself to build for the user and not development convenience.</p>
<p>I was familiar with many of the ideas in chapters 9 through 11 as techniques but these chapters did a really good job of laying out the heart behind them as well as making a business case for their use.  Frankly they also made me much more interested in reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a>, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a review of that up sometime soon (after I finish my current list of books).</p>
<p>Finally, while the implementation chapters at the end struggled a bit due to being written in a pre-agile world, it holds up because it focuses a lot on creating a design culture and isn’t just stuck on prescriptive steps for integrating designers.</p>
<p>Overall I can definitely recommend this book if you’re interested in learning more about the role of design in a healthy software development organization and you know enough about the industry to contextualize the 90s-era advice in 2018.  It is definitely a high-level book; Cooper describes it as the “business case for interaction design”, and it is written at a “business level”.  If you want a more practical and in the weeds design resource, then <a href="https://amzn.to/2IItvkP">About Face</a> is probably a better bet.  But <a href="https://amzn.to/2qeSTYz">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a> is still solid reading.</p>]]></content>

<p>The upcoming second edition of <a href="https://amzn.to/2IzhmhS">Refactoring</a> will have it’s code examples written in JavaScript.  I’d love to see more architecture-level books written for JavaScript developers.  I don’t think we have great definitive resources for those questions yet, and rewriting a classic with JS examples is a great first step.</p>

I don’t love relying on custom loaded fonts for this blog and I wish there were more high quality fonts that were reliably available without resorting to loading your own.  This particular feature doesn’t pass the “caniuse test” for now though; Chrome and Safari support it, but there’s nothing from Edge or Firefox yet.</p>
<h3>Command Line Tips</h3>
<p><a href="https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/03/26/git-log-the-good-parts/">git log – the Good Parts | Ian Miell</a> - A good rundown of some of the things you can do with git log.  It misses that you can use <code>--author</code> to filter by the committer though, which is a flag I use all the time when I know who did a specific piece of work but am vague on what actually changed.</p>
<p><a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/03/26/w/">Why I usually run ‘w’ first when troubleshooting unknown machines</a> - Here’s a useful command line command I didn’t know about.  <code>w</code> shows you a list of users currently on a machine and what they’re doing.</p>
<h3>Code Style, Documentation and Code Reviews</h3>
<p><a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/">“Just” | Brad Frost</a> - A good reminder to not assume everybody has our accumulated knowledge.  I’ve found a good cure for this is to spend some time working with programming tools I have no experience in.  Trying to install gems in Ruby for instance always reminds me how confusing npm was when I started using it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early">Avoid Else, Return Early | Tim Oxley</a> - I’ve found this pattern of short-circuiting functions to produce very readable code.  I’ve also seen these referred to as <em>guard statements</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/putting-the-i-back-in-ide-towards-a-github-explorer/">Putting the I back in IDE: Towards a Github Explorer| Jane Street Tech Blog </a> - This is an interesting idea, although I was a bit weirded out by the idea of commenting in the source files to leave code review comments.  The idea of deeper editor integration is excellent though, and I’d love to see Github evolve further in this direction with their Atom plugin.</p>

        <updated>2018-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second post in a series of posts on Computer Science basics for front end developers.  The goal is a practical focus on the practical implications of basic CS theory for JavaScript development.</em></p>
<p>Modern programmers owe a lot to the efforts of many head in the sky theoretical mathematicians from the 1800s and early 1900s who were searching for mathematical truths and ended up making discoveries that serve as the basis of many modern computing inventions.  Boolean Algebra is one of a few branches of mathematics that was developed for purely theoretical reasons that has ended up shaping the computer revolution.  It fortunately has the virtue of being a relatively approachable to mathematical newbies.</p>
<p>Boolean algebra is a study of operations on logical values. Or in more understandable language, it is studying the rules of logic when we’re limited to dealing with only 2 types of values, true or false.  The basic building blocks of boolean algebra are incredibly simple: in addition to the true and false values, usually encoded as 0 for false and 1 for true, boolean algebra considers 3 basic operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “AND” operator (<code>∧</code>)</strong> - <code>a∧b</code> is true if and only if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both true.</li>
<li><strong>The “OR” operator (<code>∨</code>)</strong> - <code>a∨b</code> is true if at least one of <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> are true and false otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>The “NOT” operator (<code>¬</code>)</strong> - <code>¬</code> is a unary operator. It only affects a single value.  <code>¬a</code> is true if <code>a</code> is false, and false if <code>a</code> is true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is a whole field of mathematics, so the interesting part comes as you start combining these pieces.  Mathematicians have discovered many “laws” that apply to boolean logic.  Some of these will probably look familiar to those of you who took high school algebra.  Here’s a sample of the laws from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>The last 3 especially are worth remembering.  Taking them out of mathematical notation for a second and using pseudocode instead, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Negation: <code>not not x == x</code></li>
<li>De Morgan 1 <code>(not x) and (not y) === not (x or y)</code></li>
<li>De Morgan 2 <code>(not x) or (not y) === not (x and y)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Boolean Algebra in JavaScript</h3>
<p>For most JavaScript developers, the preceding description of boolean algebra probably seemed suspiciously familiar.  It turns out that JavaScript has all the base units of boolean algebra in its core language.  True and false are represented by the appropriately named boolean primitives <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.  AND, OR, and NOT are represented by <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>!</code> respectively.</p>

<p>So a JavaScript statement like</p>

      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> y<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  <span class="token comment">// false</span>
  <span class="token function">willNeverHappen</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>is equivalent to <code>x∧y</code> in boolean algebra notation.  But this being JavaScript, there are some quirks and things to know about.  </p>
<p>First of all it’s worth noting that boolean logic in JavaScript is lazy by default.  That means that JavaScript will only evaluate enough of a boolean expression to know what the result will be.  So in an expression like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">alwaysReturnTrue</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">alwaysReturnFalse</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> value <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">alwaysReturnFalse</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">alwaysReturnTrue</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>the function <code>alwaysReturnTrue</code> will never be called.  This will matter when we start talking about real world takeaways.  </p>
<p>The second JavaScript quirk gets its own section.  Because booleans get more complicated when they interact with the rest of the JavaScript world.</p>
<h3>Truthy and Falsy</h3>
<p>When JavaScript conditionals like the if statement evaluate an expression, they aren’t strictly evaluating to see if something is the boolean values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.   Instead they’re looking to see if the expression is <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>.  This isn’t the kindergarten version of booleans, instead it’s JavaScript’s way of handling the fact that not all expressions are boolean.  Rather than requiring you to cast your values to boolean or use a statement that produces a boolean, JavaScript instead treats every value as either truthy or falsy.  The rules for this are reasonably consistent and easy to follow once you understand what is happening<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  It turns out that most values are truthy, so it is easiest to just learn the falsy values.  In JavaScript the falsy values are:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
undefined<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token number">NaN</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token string">''</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// or ""</span>
document<span class="token punctuation">.</span>all <span class="token comment">// Special case browser hack just for fun</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>If an expression that evaluates to one of these values is read into a boolean context like an if statement or ternary, it will be treated as false.  Any other value will be read as true.</p>
<h3>Implications and Hacks</h3>
<p>So far we’ve gone through some theory, as well as JavaScript’s own quirks.  But now let’s talk about 3 different implications of this stuff for day to day JavaScript programming.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Shortcuts using the  &#x26;&#x26; and || operators</strong> - It’s fairly common, especially in special context like minified code and JSX expressions in React, to run into code that get’s clever with the lazy behavior of JavaScript boolean operators.  Specifically the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> statement often get’s used as an inline if statement like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userID <span class="token operator">=</span> showID <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">getUserID</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>which is equivalent to</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userID<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>showID<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  userID <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">getUserID</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  userID <span class="token operator">=</span> showID<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">//presumably false or null</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>The <code>||</code> statement can be used for a similar purpose, usually to provide a fallback value.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">createNewUser</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>providedRole<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token keyword">let</span>  userRole <span class="token operator">=</span> providedRole <span class="token operator">||</span> <span class="token string">'basic-user'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token comment">//...</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>It’s important to be careful with this type of use though, because if it would be valid for the user input to be a falsy value like <code>''</code>, <code>null</code> or <code>0</code>, this can introduce subtle bugs.  More on that in a second.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t personally relying too heavily on this technique.  Besides the possibility of subtle bugs, it isn’t very approachable for new developers, especially if you try nesting logic this way.  But you should know how it works since you will see it, especially in minified code you may need to debug and JSX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>!! for casting</strong> - Another common idiom to be aware of is the use of double negation to cast values to a boolean.  It is fairly common when you have code that is expecting a boolean and not just a truthy/falsy value to convert the value to a boolean.  One way to do that is using the <code>Boolean</code> constructor, like <code>var bool = Boolean(value)</code>, but another method is to use double negation.  The first negation evaluates to the boolean that is opposite the truthy/falsy value, and the second one flips it back to the original truthy/falsy state, but as a boolean.</p>
<p>I personally find this notation to be less confusing than the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code>/<code>||</code> shortcuts, but your mileage may vary.  Either way, it’s important to understand its role since it is common to find <code>!!</code>s in real world code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>0s and empty strings are dangerous</strong> - For our last quirk, let’s imagine a code example function <code>getCountFromServer</code>:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> getUserCountFromServer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">try</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'users'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
      <span class="token keyword">let</span> users <span class="token operator">=</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
      <span class="token keyword">return</span> users<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">catch</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">e</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">// if we can't get the count, return null</span>
      <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token keyword">null</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This function makes a request from the server, and then returns the number of users, or <code>null</code> if it can’t get the value from the server for whatever reason.  Maybe not the best error handling, but certainly something you could see in real world code.  If we want to test to see if this function got data correctly, we have to be careful.  We might want to simplify our testing by taking advantage of <code>null</code>’s falsiness like this:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userCount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">getUserCountFromServer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>userCount<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something with the info</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">//handle the case where the number failed to load</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Do you see the bug?  It’s subtle.  With code written like this, if there are no users it will be treated the same as if the number had failed to load at all.  This is a pretty common bug in situations where a value might be undefined or null, but could also be a number.  Strings have a similar issue.  </p>
<p>It’s important to understand that if 0 or empty strings are a valid value for a variable, you can’t rely on a general falsiness check to see if the value is defined.  Instead it’s better to either define the exact falsy value you expect for “no value” (null in this case) or to check based on type.  For instance in this case, you could rewrite the code to look for a number:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> userCount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">getUserCountFromServer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">typeof</span> userCount <span class="token operator">===</span> <span class="token string">'number'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// do something with the info</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">//handle the case where the number failed to load</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>TC39 and the future of JavaScript/ECMAScript</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/smooshgate">#SmooshGate FAQ  |  Mathias Bynens</a> - A great explanation both of the background behind the recent twitter controversy over <code>Array.prototype.smoosh</code> as well as the TC39 process generally.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zenparsing/js-classes-1.1">js-classes-1.1 | Allen Wirfs-Brock</a> - This is the new proposal for expanding JS classes I mentioned in my <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/03/16/proposals-in-production/">post</a> last Friday.  It aims to be a more minimalist take on expanding class capabilities (primarily adding private state syntax) than other proposals that have come along over the last few years.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/wycats/b1c96c67074396a239abd60f55087adc">thoughts.md | Yehuda Katz</a> - This was a response to the JS Classes 1.1 proposal from Yehuda Katz, the lead proponent of adding decorator syntax for JavaScript classes.  He compares the new proposal to existing proposals, with specific concerns for how it would interop with decorators.</p>
<h3>Computer Science and Software Engineering</h3>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/basecs">basecs | Vaidehi Joshi</a> - While I’ve been starting to consider how to explain CS concepts for front end developers without a CS background, I found this excellent beginner set of CS articles written by Vaidehi Joshi on Medium over the past year.  Worth diving into, especially if you like fun visuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nrwl.io/the-3-skills-that-helped-me-become-a-better-software-engineer-8b06a37becf3">The 3 Skills That Helped Me Become a Better Software Engineer | Victor Savkin</a> - This is worth sharing solely for the advice about mental models.  In my experience the ability to think in abstractions (and understand when you need to dig deeper) is one of the biggest hurdles in programming when trying to grow from a beginner to a more advanced software engineer.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I’ve been working through a goal to read 30 books in a year, and have worked through a few more books recently.  Here are two good ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Gbh9R2">The Martian | Andy Weir</a> - Yes I know I’m 3 years late on this one.  But I’m sure there are other lost souls like me who entered 2018 without reading this book.  If you love tech and science (and I’m guessing you do if you’re reading this), you should find a way to read The Martian.  My first thought when I started reading it was “This is great”.  My second thought was “How in the world did this end up becoming a Hollywood Blockbuster starring Matt Damon?“.  The Martian is unapologetically geeky, and it is “real science” fiction, with a very human core. I loved it.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2G1h9ah">Death By Meeting | Patrick Lencioni</a> - This was a recommendation from my manager, and is a great read for anyone who wants to improve the meetings they’re in at work.  It’s written in a “business fable” style, with a story serving to illustrate the principles it is trying to teach.  One thing I love is that it tells the story of the principles being implemented from a lower rung employee, rather than a top-down executive driven approach, so hopefully it can be inspirational to you even if you feel like you wouldn’t be able to change your meeting culture even if you knew what to do.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2018-03-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I asked for input on the idea of <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/02/20/cs-for-fe/">resources on Computer Science for front end developers</a>.  Because there was a decent amount of interest, I’m planning on fleshing out the idea a bit with a small series of posts on CS basics.  These posts will cover some concepts that would usually be covered in an intro level CS course.  If folks find them helpful I may move on to more advanced topics like Data Structures &#x26; Algorithms, the software abstractions that modern web development is built on top of, and other math/theory topics.</p>
<p>With these posts I’m not trying to replicate a CS intro course and won’t cover everything.  I’m not trying to teach anyone how to program.  Instead I’m covering the ideas and details behind concepts that FE devs may have learned by doing but never been exposed to from an theory point of view.  I am not an academic, so the goal will be to keep a casual tone focused on the practical implications of theory to a Front End developer.  If I’m successful, these posts will give you a better set of mental models when working to understand the code you’re reading and writing every day.  That’s plenty of throat-clearing, so now I’m going to jump into one of the most fundamental building blocks of any programming language: variables.</p>
<h3>What are Variables? (Not as obvious as it sounds)</h3>
<p>Variables in programming languages are symbols that we assign to represent a value.  That seems simple enough, but that sentence is too vague to properly account for the complexity of reality.  When dealing with variables in the real world, it’s important to have a good mental model of how they really behave, or you may become confused by how your programs act.  For instance if you believe that variables are always live references to whatever other variable they were assigned to, you may be surprised by the behavior of this snippet:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> b <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>b<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">// prints 1</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>and if you believe that variables always point to a unique value that is created when you assign to them, you might be surprised by this one:</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> b <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
a<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">push</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">4</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>b<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">// prints [1, 2, 3, 4]</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Knowing generally that a variable points to a value is a great start.  But a proper understanding of the model that a programming language uses for variables can help you avoid subtle bugs.</p>
<h3>How Variables Work</h3>
<p>Here’s the most important sentence for gaining a proper understanding of how variables work: “A variable points to a location in memory.”  Explaining how memory is organized and allocated is outside the scope of this post, but for now it’s sufficient to just understand memory as a long list of blocks, each of which has it’s own address.  </p>

<p>Function arguments are based on these same concepts.  When a function is called, the argument variables are assigned to point at the memory address of the value passed into the function.</p>
<h3>Mutable vs Immutable Variables</h3>
<p>This memory address stuff can seem pretty abstract, and not very useful, but it’s a great gateway to understanding more practical topics.  A while back I wrote a post about <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2016/06/04/what-are-mutable-and-immutable-data-structures-2/">mutable and immutable data</a>.  If you’re unfamiliar with the concepts you can read the original article for background.  But basically, JavaScript values are divided into 2 categories: primitives like booleans, strings, and numbers which are immutable, and objects which are mutable.  Immutable primitives can’t be changed, when they’re operated on they can only be replaced with a new value.  Mutable objects can be changed in place.  That “in place” qualifier can seem a bit hazy without understanding the underlying memory situation, but now we can explain this more clearly: the value for a primitive will never change within a memory location, a variable will instead have to point to a new location in memory.  A mutable variable can be modified without changing it’s location in memory.  This is the explanation behind our confusing example from earlier.</p>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Because <code>b</code> points to the same location in memory as <code>a</code>, when we mutate <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> continues to point to the same array as <code>a</code> and sees the same changes we performed on <code>a</code>.</p>
<h3>Implications and Gotchas</h3>
<p>There are a few practical implications of these concepts, and gotchas that folks with the wrong mental model around variables tend to run into.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>===</code> is based on location in memory for objects</strong> - While it does compare primitive values directly to see if they’re the same value, for objects, <code>===</code> compares by reference.  So the following code works in a way that people might not expect if they don’t understand variables.</li>
</ol>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>x<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Modifying objects in functions modifies them outside of the function scope</strong> - This is a pretty common gotcha for folks who don’t understand variables and memory.  When they have a bad mental model of function arguments, you get code like the following made up example.</li>

</code></pre>
      </div>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><code>const</code> isn’t really a constant</strong> - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning/">ES6</a> introduced the new keywords for declaring variables <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.  Both help with issues around variable scoping<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, but the difference between the two can seem rather confusing.  It seems like <code>const</code> might indicate a constant value that can’t be changed.  But mutable values declared with const can in fact change:</li>
</ol>
<div class="gatsby-highlight">
      <pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> arr <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>arr<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">// [1, 2, 3, 4]</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Instead <code>const</code> is once again about memory and reference assignment.  A variable that is assigned through const can’t be reassigned to a new location in memory.  So if it is pointed to a primitive like <code>123</code> or <code>true</code>, it truly is a constant, because the value can’t change. But when it’s pointed to a mutable value, it’s reference won’t change, and it will always <code>===</code> any variables that have been assigned to it, but the actual contents of that memory can change.</p>

<p><a href="https://hph.is/coding/bitmasks-react-context">Bitmasks and the new React Context API | Haukur Hallvarðsson</a> - A nice rundown of one aspect of the new React Context API that is likely to be familiar to low-level developers but will probably be a new idea to many front end devs: using bitmasks to test a condition.</p>

To be honest, my main takeaway is that among modern frameworks “framework performance” can be a bit overrated, and not a great reason to choose a specific library or framework, as compared to factors like developer experience, community, and fit with the existing codebase.</p>
<h3>Rust And WebAssembly</h3>
<p>I’ve been thinking about taking the time to learn a new language for the first time in a while.  I think WebAssembly and Rust transpiled to WebAssembly in particular are going to become an important part of high performance JavaScript applications and frameworks/libraries.  So I’m starting to check it out.  Here are a few  recent relevant links</p>

        <link href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/03/16/proposals-in-production/">
        </link>
        <updated>2018-03-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was adopted from a twitter thread that outgrew it’s medium today.  You can see the original thread <a href="https://twitter.com/ben336/status/974670479905705984">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>This morning I saw the following tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*TC39 proposes Array.flatten feature that breaks code that was working fine for 10 years*<br>&quot;IT&#39;S THEIR FAULT FOR DOING NONSTANDARD STUFF&quot;<br><br>*TC39 proposes changing classes feature not yet in standard*<br>&quot;IT&#39;S NOT FAIR I WROTE CODE USING THAT&quot;</p>&mdash; Dave Methvin (@davemethvin) <a href="https://twitter.com/davemethvin/status/974037352384430080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>The tweet refers to <a href="https://github.com/allenwb/js-classes-1.1">this proposal</a> for replacing a number of other proposals for augmenting JS’s current class syntax, as well as recent backlash on twitter over <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-flatMap/pull/56">a proposal </a> to not use flatten or flatmap for future JS standard syntax due to their previous use in mootools.  </p>
<p>Because people have been using Babel or other tools to transpile their code and use the proposed class syntax today, it would be frustrating for many devs if the proposal shifted under them.  I’ve been there.  And thus, story time:</p>
<p>A few years ago I used a polyfill for a browser API that wasn’t yet fully supported in all browsers.  And I used it in production code.  Browser support didn’t pick up nearly as quickly as I expected, and then the spec changed.  Supporting that code has caused me problems repeatedly since, and there isn’t a lot of support, given that the syntax isn’t standardized.  Because <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2018/01/07/large-improvements-small-team/">I am working with limited resources</a> I  still haven’t been able to get rid of the polyfill code completely.  It’s baked into one of the most critical portions of my production application.  And so I’ve had to live with it and deal with some of it’s non-ideal aspects for a long time.  Since then I’ve avoided putting anything in production that isn’t in a spec.  And I have absolutely no regrets about that.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson I’ve learned:</strong> Polyfilling a partially supported spec for compatibility is fine.  Playing around with new proposals is fine (and actually a great idea if you want to influence the future of the language).  But I never want to use polyfills/transpiling for a <em>proposed spec</em> in production code. And yes that means no decorators/class properties/pipeline operators in my code for now.  But that’s ok.  JavaScript is a pretty decent language today.  A little patience will help you in the end.  Even libraries like MobX that encourage the use of “future specs” will still work without them if they’re reasonably well maintained.</p>
<h3>Why Does This Happen?</h3>
<p>To some folks the lesson of “Don’t use language features that aren’t standardized yet” probably looks obvious.  So why does this happen? I think there’s a community/culture aspect to some of this.  For instance, many of the early adopters of React really wanted to push the language forward to achieve better developer experience, and were more likely to propose and advocate for new syntax.  This was fine for them, because many of these folks were either</p>
<p>a. Employees at large companies who had the resources to support whatever code extensions they wanted, and dedicate time to a large refactor if they got it wrong (not typical of most devs)
b. Consultants/teachers who are always trying to stay on the bleeding edge for teaching purposes and who don’t build projects intended to be maintained long term (not typical of most devs)
c. Involved in the language standards process and experimenting with new syntax for the purpose of influencing the language, rather than writing production code with it (not typical of most devs)</p>
<p>Because of this, the need to compile JS for JSX purposes anyway and the heavy emphasis in the early React community on rethinking best practices, I’ve seen a lot more of this type of pre-standardization use of features in the React community than elsewhere.  The Ember community for instance doesn’t seem to have the same problems. But it started with early adopters in React, and spread when folks who were less informed about the standards process cargo-culted the code examples.  So here we are.</p>
<h3>My suggestions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learn about the ECMAScript standards process.</strong>  <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/10/how-to-follow-the-javascript-roadmap/">This post</a> can get you started.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use non-standard code in production.</strong>  It just isn’t worth the headaches you may get later.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have any interest at all in data visualization, you can’t get very far learning about it without hearing the name Edward Tufte.  His four books on the subjects have had a huge influence on the industry over the last 35 years, a time where data visualization has blossomed as it has moved from a tedious hand drawn task to a computer assisted activity that even middle schoolers can attempt with the software available on most laptops.</p>
<p>Tufte’s first book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> is also his most well known and acclaimed book<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.  It lays out many of the principles that he would go to expand on elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the data</li>
<li>“Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space”</li>
<li>Graphics should have <em>integrity</em>.  They shouldn’t mislead the reader.</li>
<li>Remove unecessary clutter</li>
<li><em>and more</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The book is also beautiful.  Tufte chose to self-publish it so that he could control the exact layout and typography.  He also mixes in many old hand drawn visualizations to mix with a fewer new computer assisted graphics.  The result is stunning, and makes for a very enjoyable read throughout, as there is always something interesting to look at.  </p>

<p>I was pleased to find that the book didn’t back up some of my own pre-conceived notions about Tufte and his work.  When I’ve seen him referenced in the past, it has been almost solely in terms of minimalism.  He was an expert witness for fewer colors, fewer lines, less ink.  But his takes here are more nuanced.  He definitely tends towards minimalism, and argues for reducing graphs to their bare minimum ink amount over conforming to familiar forms<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.  But his go to example of great data display throughout the book is hardly minimalist.  Minard’s map of Napoleon invading Russia is a complex visualization that tracks the size of an army, time, location and temperature, all in a single image.</p>

<p>Instead Tufte is really arguing for data efficiency.  Simple things should be displayed simply.  If you have a single number, don’t dress it up in a fancy graph.  Just show the number.  If you have a series of numbers, a table or simple scatter will work fine, no need for a fancy piece of chart “art”.  But when you have truly complex data, a complex visualization can make it accessible in ways that a large page of words and numbers never could on its own.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://amzn.to/2H6EB2f">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> fun, informative and inspirational.  If you work with data and have never read it, I’d definitely recommend checking it out.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rather than posting random stuff that popped up this week like usual, I wanted to instead post a set of “classic” links instead. The theme this week is Learning React.  Here are some of the links that helped me to learn different React concepts as I was first tackling it.  Note that these are links that helped me learn the concepts behind different parts of the React ecosystem.  Some are intro level, while some assume basic familiarity with the concepts they discuss.</p>
<h3>The Motivation Behind React</h3>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">Thinking In React</a> - It’s strange, but I never expect the official docs for a project to be the best explanation of their purpose.  Official documentation tends to lean towards the “how” rather than the “why”, and the motivations of the maintainers aren’t always the motivations of the community anyway.  But this article from the React docs remains the best explanations of the problems that React is solving as well as the way that it solves them.</p>
<p><a href="https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui">Pure UI</a> - Even moreso than <em>Thinking in React</em>, this 2015 article nails the paradigm shift that React represented.  The power of UI as a function of data has been the biggest change I’ve experienced in my career building UIs, and this article was like a message in the bottle from the future when it was first written 3 years ago.</p>
<h3>Flux, MobX and Redux</h3>
<p><a href="https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-guide-to-flux-6157355ab207">A cartoon guide to Flux | Lin Clark</a> - This was a nice early run through of the Flux concepts.  Lin Clark is one of the best “front end explainers” out there, and she does a good job here.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-fundamental-principles-behind-mobx-7a725f71f3e8">The Fundamental Principles Behind MobX | Michael Weststrate</a> - Like most of the other links here, this is a theory link, not a practical introduction.</p>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux">Getting Started With Redux | Dan Abramov on Egghead.io </a> - Like <em>Thinking with React</em>, this is a great introduction to a library that starts with the problems to be solved and shows how a new library solves that problem, rather than simply telling you what a tool does.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">You Might Not Need Redux | Dan Abramov</a> - Another helpful article for understanding what Redux is and isn’t solving for, helpful if you’re trying to decide whether to include it in a project.</p>
<h3>React Patterns</h3>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns">Advanced React Component Patterns | Kent C Dobbs on Egghead.io</a> - This is my one paid content link, but its so good that its worth sharing.  This was a fantastic course that covers patterns like Higher Order Components, Render props and more.  It discusses both the implementation concerns and motivation behind each.</p>
<h3>Future Stuff</h3>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b">React’s New Context API | Kent C Dobbs</a> - This is fairly recent, but Kent Dobbs gave a great explanation of React’s new context API</p>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html">Sneak Peek: Beyond React 16 | React Blog</a> - I posted this last week as well, but this is a great inspirational talk on where React is going next.</p>]]></content>
