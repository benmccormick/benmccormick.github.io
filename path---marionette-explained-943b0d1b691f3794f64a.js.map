It is widely used in the Backbone community, but since most of the resources I found about it were written prior to it's 2.0 version, and the framework had continued to evolve significantly since then, I felt there was a need for a detailed resource on using it.  This was my attempt at creating that resource.  Note that since I published this, Marionette has released a 3rd major version, Marionette 3.
