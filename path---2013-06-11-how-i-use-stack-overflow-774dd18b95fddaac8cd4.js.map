The most obvious way is allowing open-ended questions to be asked, with answers crowd-sourced from a global community of developers.  The killer feature when asking questions is that developers often won’t answer within the scope of what you asked; they’ll help you ask the right questions instead.  If you ask how to change the backgrounds of a group of DOM items given a list of ids, you’re likely to get an answer (or 5) while also helpfully being informed of the existence of classes.  Because multiple answers are allowed you may be exposed to multiple approaches. There is plenty to be learned this way.  Stack Overflow also helps automate this process by suggesting related questions as you type your questions, based on keywords.  The AI behind this is quite good, and usually causes me to abandon my question writing as I realize that my question has already been asked and answered.</p>\\n<h4>Learning</h4>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Questions asked by other people that you can’t answer are the best part of Stack Overflow</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Stack Overflow really began making a difference in my work and learning though when I moved past asking questions and also began contributing.
